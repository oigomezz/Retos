# Partitioning

Given a binary string of length N(containing only 0's and 1's) and two integers C,P.

Put exactly 3 dividers in the string so that the integer between first and second divider (its decimal equivalent) is C and that between second and third divider is P(its decimal equivalent). There cannot be more than 25 digits in binary representation of P or C(inclusive of preceeding or leading 0's). Find the number of ways to put these dividers.

## Input format

- The first line contains a string of binary numbers.
- The next line contains 2 space-seperated integers C and P

## Output format

In a single line, print the number of ways in which the 3 dividers can be put.
