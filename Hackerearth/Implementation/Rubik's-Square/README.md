# Rubik's Square

Raj has bought a new Rubik's Cube and he try to solve it day and night. Seeing this , Vikas tried to help Raj by giving him problem based on cube Rotation . To make it easier for Raj , As Raj is a beginner Vikas gave problem in square matrix instead of cube. The problem is as follows :

Vikas has N\*N array of different numbers. Now he rotates the rows and columns . Raj has to stay focused and tell Vikas what should be output of matrix after R Rows Rotation and C columns rotation.

Raj is now more confused then ever from the above problem. Help him to find the answer.

Note: First all the rows will be rotated and then all the columns will be rotated. Rotation will be from left to right (for Rows) and Top to Bottom (for Column).

## Input format

- First line contain the N,R,C
- Next N lines contains N space separated integer denoting element in matrix.
- Next line contains R space separated integer denoting index of Row to be rotated.(Index starts from 1).
- Next line contains C space separated integer denoting index of Column to be rotated.(Index starts from 1).

## Output format

Output the N\*N matrix generated after above operation.
