# Fill the Boxes

You are given an array of size N, denoting capacity of N boxes, and an integer K, denoting extended capacity factor. You are also given the weights of M balls. Each ith box can accommodate exactly one ball having weight in range [capacityi, capacityi + K] (both inclusive). Find the maximum number of boxes that can be filled.

## Input format

- First line: T i.e. Number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - First line: Three space-separated integers N, M and K.
  - Second line: N space-separated integers denoting the capacity of boxes.
  - Third line: M space-separated integers denoting the weight of balls.

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer in a separate line.
