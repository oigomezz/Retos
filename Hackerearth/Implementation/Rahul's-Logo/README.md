# Rahul's Logo

Rahul has set upon the quest for a new logo of his company. He has created the following continuous logo.

However, his sister, Rashi, likes the following discontinuous design more

The size of a logo is the longest continuous streak of same characters on an arm.

So, size of 1st logo is 5 while that of 2nd one is 4.

Now, he wants to paint both of these logos on a canvas.

Given an integer N, write a program that outputs these logos for sizes N and N + 1, one below the other.

Please note that Rahul's logo is only valid for odd sizes and Rashi's logo is only valid for even values.

## Input format

Each file has just one line containing integer N.

## Output format

Output the two logos, one below the other.
