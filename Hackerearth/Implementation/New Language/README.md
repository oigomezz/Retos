# New Language

A new mathematical language (let's call it Ninja) is discovered, in which 8 is completely missing.

So, new counting becomes (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,...). Whole counting is written without 8.

For example, 29 comes after 27, 90 comes after 79, etc.

Thus 27 + 1 = 29, 79 + 1 = 90.

Now, your task is to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on two numbers in this new language Ninja.

**NOTE:** The final output also has to be in the language Ninja.

## Input format

The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case, two integers a and b are given, separated with any one of the above operation (+,-,\*,/).
It is guaranteed that answer will not be negative.
For division operation, you have to answer integer division.

## Output format

For each test case, print the output of operation in Ninja.
