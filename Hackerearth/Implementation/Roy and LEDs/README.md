# Roy and LEDs

Its Diwali time and there are LED series lights everywhere. Little Roy got curious about how LED lights work.

He noticed that in one single LED Bulb there are 3 LED lights, namely Red, Green and Blue.

State of the bulb at any moment is the sum of Red, Green and Blue LED light.

Roy took out all the LEDs and found that Red LED stays ON for R seconds, Green LED stays ON for G seconds and Blue LED stays ON for B seconds. Similarly they stay OFF for same respective R, G, B number of seconds. (Initially all the LEDs are OFF. See Sample Test Case Explanation for better understanding)

Roy has one query for you, given the total number of seconds T, find the number of seconds Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, White, Black(no light) lights are visible.

## Input format

One line containing space separated integers T, R, G, B

## Output format

One line containing 8 space separated integers indicating the number of seconds Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Magenta, White, Black (no light) lights are visible. (See Sample I/O for clarification)
