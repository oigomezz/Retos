Now Watson gives a N and K to Sherlock and asks if K is a possible special count for any permutation of first N positive integers.

## Input format

- First line contains T, the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of N and K in one line.

## Output format

For each test case, print "YES" or "NO", denoting whether K is a possible special count or not.
