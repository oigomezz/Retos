# Geometric Sequence

Given a sequence a1,a2,...,an.
You need to find a subsequence ab1,ab2,...,abm (b1 < b2 < ... < bm) and an integer k which satifies abi+1 = k abi for all 1 <= i <= m.
Your goal is to maximize m.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer n.
- Second line contains n integers, representing the sequence a1,a2,...,an.

## Output format

An integer representing the maximum value of m.
