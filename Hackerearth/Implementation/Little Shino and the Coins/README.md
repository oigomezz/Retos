# Little Shino and the coins

Little Shino loves to play with coins. In the city she lives, there are 26 different types of coins. Each coin is represented with a lowercase letter a,b,c,...,x,y,z. Shino has some number of coins and she placed them in some random sequence, S, on the table. She is wondering how many pairs (i,j) are there, where i <= j, such that number of distinct coins in sequence Si,Si+1,Si+2,...,Sj-1,Sj is exactly equal to K. Two coins of same type (same letters) are considered equal and two coins of different types (different letters) are considered distinct.

## Input format

- First line contains one integer, K.
- Second line contains a string, S, consist of lowercase letters only.

## Output format

Print one integer, number of pairs (i,j), where i <= j, such that number of distinct coins in sequence Si,Si+1,Si+2,...,Sj-1,Sj is exactly equal to K.
