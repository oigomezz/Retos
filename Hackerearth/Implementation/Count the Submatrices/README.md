# Count the Submatrices

A matrix of size M x N where M and N are integers that denote the number of rows and columns of the matrix respectively. The matrix contains integer elements only. You are given an integer P.

Write a program to determine the number of submatrices of this matrix such that the sum of all the elements of a submatrix is divisible by P.

## Input format

- First line: M, N, and P
- Next M lines: N

## Output format

Print the number of submatrices such that the sum of all the elements in those submatrices is divisible by P.
