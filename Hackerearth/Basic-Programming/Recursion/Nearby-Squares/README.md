# [Nearby Squares][link]

You are given an array of length A. There are two empty arrays, B and C. You have to put every element of A into either B or C.

The score of an array is defined as the square of the sum of all of its elements. Find the minimum possible absolute difference between the score of B and C.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the length of the array A.
- The second line of each test case contains N integers, denoting the elements of array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum possible absolute difference between the score of B and the score of C.
