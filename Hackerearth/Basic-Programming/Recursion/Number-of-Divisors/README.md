# [Number of divisors][link]

You are given two numbers n and k. For each number in the interval [1, n], your task is to calculate its largest divisor that is not divisible by k. Print the sum of these divisors.

**Note:** k is a prime number.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases that will follow.
- Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k.

## Output format

The output must contain the answer for each test case on a different line.

Each answer consists of a single integer.
