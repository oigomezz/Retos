# [Divide Number][link]

Given integer N, you need to find four integers A,B,C,D, such that they're all factors of N(A|N, B|N, C|N, D|N), and N = A + B + C + D. Your goal is to maximize A x B x C x D.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer T, represents the number of test cases.
- Each of the next T lines contains an integer N.

## Output format

T lines, each line contains the answer (A x B x C x D) to correspond test case. If there is no way to find such four numbers, output .
