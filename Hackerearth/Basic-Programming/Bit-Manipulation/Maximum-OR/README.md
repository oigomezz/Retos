# [Maximum OR][link]

You are given an array A containing N integers. You can do the following operation at most K times:

- Choose any index i and increase the value of Ai by 1.

Your task is to find the maximum bitwise OR of the array.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers denoting array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum possible bitwise OR of the array after performing at most K operations in a new line.
