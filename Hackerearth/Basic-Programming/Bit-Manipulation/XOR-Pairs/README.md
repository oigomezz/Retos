# [XOR Pairs][link]

You are given an array A of N non-negative integers. Find the number of pairs of indices (i,j), such that A[i] + j = i + A[j], where + is the bitwise XOR operator.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

- For each test case, the first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array A. The next line contains N space-seperated integers denoting the elements of the array.

## Output format

The output must contain a single integer, that is the number of pairs described in the statement.
