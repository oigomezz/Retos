# [Xsquare And Two Strings][link]

Xsquare loves to play with strings a lot. Today, he has two strings S1 and S2 both consisting of lower case alphabets. Xsquare listed all subsequences of string S1 on a paper and all subsequences of string S2 on a separate paper. Xsquare wants to know whether there exists a string which is listed on both the papers.
