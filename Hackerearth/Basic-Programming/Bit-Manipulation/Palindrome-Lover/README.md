# Palindrome Lover

Given an array of N integers.

You have to transform the array, for every i (1 <= i <= N): a[i] = a[i] % 2

For example: if the given array is 3,4,5 then after the transformation the array will be 1,0,1

Your task is to convert the array into a palindrome and for that you can re-arrange the elements however you wish

Is it possible to convert the array into a palindrome?

## Input format

- The first line contains T, the number of test cases 1 <= T <= 10³
- The second line contains N, the number of array elements 1 <= N <= 10⁵
- The third line contains N integers, the array elements 1 <= a[i] <= 10⁹

## Output format

For all test cases print 1 if the array can be converted into a palindrome or else print 0
