# [Maximum bit shifts][link]

You are given a sequence of N numbers. You can perform the following operation:

Select a number from the sequence and swap any pair of bits in its binary representation (Binary representation does not have any leading zeroes).

Output the lexicographic maximum sequence possible after performing 0 or more of the above operations.

## Input format

- First line: A single integer N denoting the number of integers.
- Second line: N integers denoting the array elements.

## Output format

Print N space-separated integers denoting the lexicographic maximum sequence possible.
