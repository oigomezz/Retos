# [MAX AND][link]

You are given array A, B each containing N integers. You have to create array C of N integers where Ci = Ai & Bi (Here, & denotes the Bitwise AND operation). You can shuffle elements of A, B however you want. Find maximum value of C1 & C2 & ... & Cn.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows:
- For each test case:

  - The first line contains an integer N denotes size of array A, B.
  - The next line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., An - denoting the elements of A.
  - The next line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., Bn- denoting the elements of B.

## Output format

For each test case, print maximum value of C1 & C2 & ... & Cn in a separate line.
