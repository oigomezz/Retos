# [Monk and Tasks][link]

Monk A loves to complete all his tasks just before the deadlines for introducing unwanted thrill in his life. But, there is another Monk D who hates this habit of Monk A and thinks it's risky.

To test Monk A, Monk D provided him tasks for N days in the form of an array Array, where the elements of the array represent the number of tasks.

The number of tasks performed by Monk A on the ith day is the number of ones in the binary representation of Arrayi.

Monk A is fed up of Monk D, so to irritate him even more, he decides to print the tasks provided in non-decreasing order of the tasks performed by him on each day. Help him out!

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer T, where T is the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains N, where N is the number of days.
- The second line of each test case contains Array array having N elements, where Arrayi represents the number of tasks provided by Monk D to Monk A on ith day.

## Output format

Print all the tasks provided to Monk A in the non-decreasing order of number of tasks performed by him.
