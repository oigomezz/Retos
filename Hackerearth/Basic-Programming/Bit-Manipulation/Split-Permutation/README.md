# [Split Permutation][link]

You are given an array A of distinct integers and another array B which is a permutation of array A. Find the maximum number of segments array could be split such that within each segment, Array B is a permutation of array A.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer, T - denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers n - denoting the length of the array A.
- The second line of each test case contains n integers — elements of array A.
- The second line of each test case contains n integers — elements of array B which is a permutation of array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer in a new line.
