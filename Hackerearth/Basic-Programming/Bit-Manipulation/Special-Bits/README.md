# Special bits

There are T test cases. Each test case contains the following:

You are given three integers L and R that denote a range and k. Your task is to find a number in between the range L to R (inclusive) which has a set bit count as k.

If there are multiple such numbers present in the range, print the minimum among such numbers. If no number satisfies the above condition, print -1.

## Input format

- The first line contains one integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case consists of three integers L, R, and k.

## Output format

For every test case, print one integer denoting the answer to the problem.
