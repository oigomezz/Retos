# [Cyclic shifts][link]

You are given a number N represented as a binary representation of X = 16 bits. You are also given a number m and a character c ( L or R).

Determine a number M that is generated after cyclically shifting the binary representation of N by m positions either left if c = L or right is c = R.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T representing the number of queries.
- The next T lines contain N m c as mentioned in the problem statement.

## Output format

Print T integers in a separate line representing the answer to each query.
