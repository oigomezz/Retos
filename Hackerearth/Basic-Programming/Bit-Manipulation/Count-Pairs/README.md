# Count Pairs

You are given a sequence of integers A of length N. Find the number of pairs of indices (i,j) (1 <= i < j <= N) for which min(A[i],A[j]) <= A[i] + A[j].

Here, + denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers ​A1, A2, ..., An.

## Output format

For each test case print a single integer — the answer to the problem.
