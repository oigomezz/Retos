# A subset in a sequence

You are given a set S consisting of non-negative powers of three S = {1, 3, 9, ...}. Consider the sequence of all non-empty subsets of S ordered by the value of the sum of their elements. You are also given a single element n. You are required to find the subset at the nth position in the sequence and print it in increasing order of its elements.

## Input format

- The first line contains one integer q denoting the number of queries. t test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case consists of a single integer n.

## Output format

- In the first line, print the size of the nth subset.
- In the next line, print the elements of the nth subset in increasing order separated by space.
