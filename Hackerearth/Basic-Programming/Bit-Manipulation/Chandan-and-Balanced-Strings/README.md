# [Chandan and Balanced Strings][link]

Chandan got bored playing with the arrays all the time. Therefore he has decided to buy a string S consists of N lower case alphabets. Once he purchased the string, He starts formulating his own terminologies over his string S. Chandan calls a string str A Balanced String if and only if the characters of the string str can be paritioned into two multisets M1 and M2 such that M1= M2 .

For eg:

Strings like "abccba" , "abaccb" , "aabbcc" are all balanced strings as their characters can be partitioned in the two multisets M1 and M2 such that M1 = M2.

M1 = {a,b,c}

M2 = {c,b,a}

whereas strings like ababab , abcabb are not balanced at all.

Chandan wonders how many substrings of his string S are Balanced String ? Chandan is a little guy and do not know how to calculate the count of such substrings.

Can you help him in accomplishing this task ?

## Input format

- First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- First and the only line of each test case contains a string consists of lower case alphabets only denoting string S.

## Output format

For each test case, print the count of Balanced Substrings of string S.
