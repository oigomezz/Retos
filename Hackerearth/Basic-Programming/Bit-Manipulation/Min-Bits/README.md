# [Min Bits][link]

Your college professor has given you a task to pass the semester. The task is as follows:

You are given 2 integers L and R which denotes a range. Find a number in between(L and R inclusive) which has the minimum number of set bits count. If there are multiple such numbers, print the minimum number.

**Note:** 14 can be written as 1110 in binary and its set bit count is 3.

## Input format

- First line containing 1 integer T
- Next T line containing 2 integers L and R.

## Output format

A single integer, denoting the number with minimum set bit count.
