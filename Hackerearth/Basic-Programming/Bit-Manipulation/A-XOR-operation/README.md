# [A XOR operation][link]

You are given a set S of distinct positive integers of size n (n is always even). Print the minimum positive integer k that is greater than 0 such that after replacing each element e of the set S with e âŠ• k, set S remains the same.

Print -1 if there is no such k.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting the number of elements in the set.
- The second line of each test case contains n integers e.

## Output format

Print t lines each containing a single line that contains k.
