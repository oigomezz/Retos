# [Sherlock and Special Count][link]

Let's say P= [P1, P2 . . . PN] is a permutations of all positive integers less than or equal to N. A function called "special count" F(P)

Now Watson gives a N and K to Sherlock and asks if K is a possible special count for any permutation of first N positive integers.

## Input format

- First line contains T, the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of N and K in one line.

## Output format

For each test case, print "YES" or "NO", denoting whether K is a possible special count or not.
