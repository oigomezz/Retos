# [Inverse List][link]

There are many ways to order a list of integers from 1 to n. For example, if n = 3, the list could be : [3,1,2].

But there is a special way to create another list from the given list of integers. In this list, position of integer i is the ith number in the given list. So following this rule, the given list will be written as: [2,3,1]. This list is called inverse list. Now there exists some list whose inverse list is identical. For example, inverse list of [1,2,3] is same as given list. Given a list of integers you have to determine whether the list is inverse or not.

## Input format

- The first line is the number of test cases t .
- The first line of each test case contains an integer n.
- Then a list of the integers 1 to n follows in the next line.

## Output format

For each test case, you have to determine whether the list is inverse or not.
