# [Shil and Square Sum][link]

Shil has an array of N elements A1 , A2, ... ,AN . He also has an integer K. He wants to find out value of Square Sum for every i from 1 to N-K+1.

The value of Square Sum for certain i is defined as Σ1≤ j ≤ K (j2 Ai+j-1).

## Input format

- First line of input consists of two integers N and K.
- Next line consists of N integers A1 , A2, ... ,AN.

## Output format

Output N-K+1 integers where ith integer corresponds to Square Sum of i. Print Square Sum modulus 10^9 + 7.
