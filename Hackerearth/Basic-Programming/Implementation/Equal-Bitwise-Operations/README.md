# [Equal Bitwise Operations][link]

A sequence of integers is said to be beautiful if the bitwise AND, OR, and XOR of its elements are pairwise equal to each other.

You are given a sequence A of size N. Find the number of non-empty subsequences of A that are beautiful. Print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer N representing the number of elements in the sequence.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,An representing the sequence.

## Output format

In a single line, print the number of non-empty subsequences of A that are beautiful.
