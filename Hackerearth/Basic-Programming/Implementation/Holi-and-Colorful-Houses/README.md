# [Holi And Colorful Houses][link]

This Holi, Monk wants to distribute sweets to the houses of his colony. The houses of the colony are present in a circular order (i.e. house 1 and house N are adjacent to each other).

Kids love to play with colors but currently there is a supply of only 2 types of colors (Red represented by R and Green represented by G). Due to festive season each of the kids have colored their houses with either green or red color.

Monk is given a task of distributing sweets Q number of times. Every time he is asked to travel from xth house to yth house to distribute the sweets.
The distribution strategy is that he starts from xth house and he has to give 1 sweet to a house only when he travels from green house to a red house or vice-versa. Monk can travel from xth house to yth house either in clockwise direction or in anti-clockwise direction.
Monk wants your help to find the minimum number of sweets he should carry to complete his journey.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains an integer N and Q.

- Then Q lines follow, each containing 2 integers x and y.

## Output format

For each test case print Q lines containing the minimum number of sweets he must carry with himself.
Second line should contain the same string S.
