# [Even Length Palindromic Number][link]

You have to design a new model which maps an even length palindromic number to some digit between 0 to 9.
The number is mapped to a digit x on the basis of following criteria:

1. x should appear maximum number of times in the palindromic number, that is, among all digits in the number, x should appear maximum number of times.
2. If more than one digit appears maximum number of times, x should be the smallest digit among them.

Given an integer N, you have to find the digit x for the Nth even length palindromic number.

**Note** First 9 even length palindromic numbers are: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99

## Input format

- First line contains T, number of test cases.
- Each of the next T lines contains an integer N.

## Output format

For each test case, print the digit to which the Nth even length palindromic number is mapped.

Answer for each test case should come in a new line.
