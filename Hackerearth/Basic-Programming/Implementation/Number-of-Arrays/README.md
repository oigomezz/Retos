# [Number of Arrays][link]

You are given an array A. You need to divide this array into exactly K non-empty segments and check whether the minimum element S amongst the maximum elements amongst all segments is less than Q or not.
In other words, if we store the maximum element of each of the segment in an array P, then you have to check if minimum element in P is less than Q or not.

## Input format

- First line of input contains number of testcases, T
- First line of each testcase contains three integers: N denoting number of elements in array A, K denoting number of segments and Q.
- Second line of each testcase contains N space-separated integers, A1, A2, ... An.

## Output format

- For each testcase, if S is less than Q, print S, else print "NO" (without quotes).
- Answer for each test case should come in a new line.
