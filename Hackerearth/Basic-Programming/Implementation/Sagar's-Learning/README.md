# [Sagar's Learning][link]

Sagar is good mathematician as well as CSE student and has learned few concepts such as HCF and LCM. Now, to test his learning , his room-mate Mohith gave him a number N and asked him to give biggest possible HCF that can be obtained by 3 numbers less than or equal to N (All 3 numbers need to be distinct).

Help Sagar to find the solution.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer T,denoting the number of testcases.
- Next T line follows number N.

## Output format

Output the answer in next line, if Multiple answer are possible then print the smallest three numbers in increasing order and if no solution, then print -1
