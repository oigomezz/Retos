# [HAWKEYE AND FLOODFILL][link]

Hawkeye is a MARVEL character who has a perfect aim in archery. Its almost impossible for him to miss his aim. As you are the head of technical team at MARVEL , you have been assigned a very critical task. During practice hawkeye uses a square archery practice board. For our convenience we will assume it to be a N \* N matrix. He shoots an arrow at position i,j with power P. Now power reduces by 1 as we move away from position i,j . Your task is to show the graph representing the impact of the arrow on the practice board.

## Input format

- First line of input contains a single integer N denoting the size of the practice board.
- Second line contains 3 integers i,j denoting position at which arrow was shot and p denoting the power used to shoot the arrow.

## Output format

Output a 2D matrix representing the impact on the practice board.
