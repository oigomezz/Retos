# [The Alphabet Chocolate][link]

A long chocolate was given as a gift to Alice by Bob. The chocolate is a series of square tiles connected to each other in a straight line. Each chocolate piece contains an alphabet carved on it.

Now Alice picks a single part of chocolate and eats it. Taste of a chocolate's part is determined by how many squares are there in that part on which a vowel is carved.

Since there are lots of ways for Alice to choose her chocolate part , find the sum of tastes of all the possible chocolate parts that can be cut out of the given chocolate.

**Note** Vowels are the following alphabets : {'a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U'}.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each of the next T lines contains a string S which denotes the design of the chocolate as mentioned in the problem.

## Output format

For each test case, print the value of taste sum as mentioned in the problem.
Answer for each test case should be printed in a new line.
