Stevie G is one of the greatest ever players to have played football, and he's going to be the one who recites all problems to you today.

Now, he is a true admirer of mathematical geniuses like you. So he has a series of programming problems, among which the first one is :

You have been given 2 integer arrays A and B each of size N. Now we call a pair of indices (i,j) connected, if i = j or A[i] = A[j].

Now, for each index i in the array A where 1 <= i <= N, you need to find the maximum B[j] such that indices i and j are connected. Can you do it ?

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer N.
- The next line contains N space separated integers, where the ith integer denotes A[i]. The next line too contains N space separated integers, where the ith integer on this line denotes B[j].

## Output format

Print N space separated integers according to those mentioned in the problem statement.
