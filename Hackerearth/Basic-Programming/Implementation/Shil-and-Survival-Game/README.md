# [Shil and Survival Game][link]

The Mad King arrested Shil's comrades for participating in a rebellion against the King. Instead of punishing them with death, the King decided to play the Game of survival with them. The game is played as follows:

- All the N people are forced to stand in a line.
- Now the king randomly chooses any two persons standing next to each other in line and kills the one having lower strength.
- King keeps on performing step 2 until there are only 2 survivors.
- The Last two survivors are forgiven for their crimes and are free to go.

As Shil is worried for his comrades, he wants to find out the ones who could survive - at least, one out of all the possible games.

Given N integers denoting the strengths of comrades, you must print the position of comrades who could survive at least one Game.

## Input format

- The first Line of input consists of an integer N denoting the total number of comrades.
- The next line consists of N integers S1, S2, ..., SN denoting the strength of comrades standing in a line. Si denotes the strength of ith comrade standing in a line. The strengths of all the comrades will be distinct.

## Output format

Print the positions of comrades standing in line who could be one of the two possible survivors in any possible game. You must print the positions in an increasingly sorted manner.
