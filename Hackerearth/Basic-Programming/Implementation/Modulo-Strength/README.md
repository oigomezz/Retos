# [Modulo Strength][link]

Alice is the teacher of a class having N students, where each student is having some personality value, given in the form of an array A. Here Ai denotes the personality value of ith student, where 1 <= i <= N. Alice has special integer K with her. Student i is a friend of Student j, if and only if (A[i] % K) = (A[j] % K). Each student's strength is equal to the number of friends he/she has. Alice needs to calculate the sum of the strength of all the students in the class. Help Alice for the same.

**Note:** This is a Code golf problem. You need to write code with minimum number of characters.
