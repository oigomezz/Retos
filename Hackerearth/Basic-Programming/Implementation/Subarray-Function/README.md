# [Subarray Function][link]

**Note:** This is an approximate problem. There is no exact solution. You must find the most optimal solution. Please, take a look at the sample explanation to ensure that you understand the problem correctly.

Problem statement​

You are given an array A of N elements and two integers L and R.

Choose an array B which is a permutation of array [1, 2, 3, …., N - 1, N] and build an array C as C[i] = A[B[i]].

The goal is to maximize the value of array function Z

## Input format

- First line contains three space separated integers N L R.
- Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the value array A.

## Output format

Print N space separated integers denoting the array B
