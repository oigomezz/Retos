# [Compress the String][link]

Given a string S of lowercase english alphabets of length N. You need to compress the string with the following rules:

1. Convert the first letter to the uppercase
2. Convert the substring consisting of all the consonants to the length of this substring (e.g. abcde to a3e)
3. Remove the consecutive duplicate vowels (e.g. aaaeiia to aeia)

**Note:** The first letter will not follow the rules 2 and 3.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains the number T, the total number of the test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains the number N, the length of the string S.
- The second line of each test case contains the string S.

## Output format

For each test case print the compressed string according to the above-mentioned rules.
