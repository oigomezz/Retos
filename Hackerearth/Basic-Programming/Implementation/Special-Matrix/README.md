# [Special matrix][link]

You have an N x M matrix, where 1 to N are rows and 1 to M are columns.

Element at the intersection of ith row and jth column is equal to F(i+j), where F(x) is equal to the number of prime divisors of x.

Determine the sum of all the elements of the matrix.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the first line contains two space-separated integers N, M.

## Output format

For each test case, print the sum of all the elements of the matrix in a new line.
