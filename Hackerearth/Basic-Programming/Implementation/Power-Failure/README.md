# [Power Failure][link]

Dexter is a young genius. He is so smart that he has built a big laboratory for himself. His rival’s name is Mandark. Dexter’s laboratory has developed a power failure due to a prank played on him by Mandark. He decided to buy batteries to temporarily provide power to his lab. His lab has n machines. The ith machine requires a battery with voltage rating of atleast Vi volts (1 <= i <= n). Dexter went to the local electronics shop. They have one battery of each voltage rating from 1 to M. Dexter is very suspicious of his rival Mandark. He thinks that Mandark has planted bombs in batteries with a prime voltage rating. He doesn’t want those batteries. As his lab computer is not working, Dexter wants you to find out the number of ways he can buy batteries for each of his machines.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains t, the number of test cases. t test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of two lines.
  - The first line contains n and m.
  - The second line contains n space separated integers denoting Vi.

## Output format

For each test case output a single number, that is the answer for that test case. Output the number of ways modulo 1000000007 (10⁹ + 7).
