# Mancunian in Palindromia

Mancunian lives in the magical far-away land of Palindromia. Due to his patriotic nature, he wants each and every one of his friends' name to be a palindrome. Note that Mancunian's patriotism does not extend towards his own name.
To please him, each of his friends decide to change their name so that it becomes a palindrome. They can do that by choosing at most two non-overlapping substrings of their own name and reversing them.
Given a list of Mancunian's friends' names which consist only of lowercase letters, count the total number of friends who will be successful.

## Input format

- The first line contains two integers N and L, denoting the number of friends Mancunian has and the maximum length of a person's name in Palindromia respectively.
- The ith of the next N lines contains a single string S denoting the name of the ith friend.

## Output format

Print a single integer, which is the answer to the given problem.
