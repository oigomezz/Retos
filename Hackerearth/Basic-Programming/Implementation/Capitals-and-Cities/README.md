# [Capitals and Cities][link]

Suppose we have n cities with integer coordinate on a line. First, we have to select a city to be the capital. Then in each operation, we have to choose a non-capital city and change it's coordinate by 1 ( -1 or +1). We have to pick the capital and do the operations exactly k time so that the sum of distances from cities to the capital is minimized. Print the index of the selected capital and the desired sum after exactly k operations. If there are multiple such choices, output the smallest index of an optimal capital.

You are required to print the index of the selected capital and required sum after k operations. If there are multiple such choices, print the smallest index of an optimal capital.

## Input format

- First line: Two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 300000)
- Second line: n integers where the ith integer that contains the coordinate of the ith city

## Output format

Print two integers that represent the index of the capital and the minimized required sum respectively.
