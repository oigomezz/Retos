# [Perpendicular Lines][link]

Given 4 points of the form (xi, yi) in 2D plane, find out if the lines formed by (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), (x4, y4) are perpendicular to each other.

**NOTE:** It is NOT provided that the points are distinct i.e the first two or the last two points may be equal too!

## Input format

- First line T is the number of test cases. Each test case is followed by 2 lines.
- The first line of every test case contains four integers (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
- The second line contains four integers (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).

## Output format

For every test case:

- print "YES" without quotes if the lines are perpendicular to each other
- print "NO" without quotes if the lines are not perpendicular
- print "INVALID" without quotes if there are less than 2 lines
