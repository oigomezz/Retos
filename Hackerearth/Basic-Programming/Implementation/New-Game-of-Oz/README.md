# [New Game of Oz][link]

Today Oz is playing a new game. He has an array arr[] of N distinct integers . In each turn he is will follow two actions:

1. He select a random number from arr[]. Say value of this element is X.
2. He will remove X from arr[]. if X-1 is present in arr[] then he will remove it. if X+1 is present in arr[] then he will remove it.

Oz will make turns until arr[] becomes empty. Oz loves this game so he wants to make maximum number of possible turns. Help Oz to make maximum number of possible turns.

## Input format

- The first line contains the number of test cases - T.
- Each test case consist of two lines.
  - First line will contain a integer N - number of elements in arr[].
  - Second line will contain N space separated integers.

## Output format

For each test case output maximum number of possible turns that Oz can make.
