# [Rhezo and Character Frequency][link]

Rhezo got a string S, a character C and an integer P as a birthday gift from his best friend JK.

He got curious about the gift and started analysing it. He found out that the maximum frequency of character C over all the P length substrings of S is equal to some integer Z.

He doesn't know programming, so asks you to find the largest position, where, if we insert some character after that position, the maximum frequency of C over all the P length substrings becomes Z + 1. If there is no such position, output 1.

If the answer is the position before the first character, output 0.

## Input format

- First line of the input contains a string S.
- Second line of the input contains the character C.
- Next and the last line contains a single integer P.

## Output format

Print an answer in a separate line.
