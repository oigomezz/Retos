# [Number of Cycles][link]

You are given an N-sided regular polygon. You have connected the center of the polygon with all the vertices, thus dividing the polygon into N equal parts.

Your task is to find the count of simple cycles that exist in the modified structure of the polygon.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
- The second line contains an integer N denoting the number of sides in the regular polygon.

## Output format

Print the count of simple cycles corresponding to each query in a separate line.
