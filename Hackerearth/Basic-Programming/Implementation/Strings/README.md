# Strings

Anton and Artur are old friends. Today they practice in writing strings. Anton must write each string with the lengths exactly N , based on the alphabet of size M . And Arthur, on the contrary, should write each string with the lengths exactly M , based on the alphabet of size N . Guys spend 1 second to write a single string. They start writing at the same time.
And now boys are interested in one question. Is it true, that they will finish together? (It is assumed that the guys don't pause during the writing of strings).

## Input format

- First line of the input contains the number of test cases T. It is followed by T tets cases. - Each test case has 1 line. Line contains two integer numbers N and M separated by a single space.

## Output format

For each test case output "YES" if Anton and Artur will finish at the same time. Else print "NO".
