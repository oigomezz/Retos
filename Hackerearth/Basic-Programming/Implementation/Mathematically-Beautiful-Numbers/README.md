# [Mathematically Beautiful Numbers][link]

While playing a mental math game, you realize that the number k is mathematically beautiful.

You then realize that the number x can be mathematically beautiful if it is represented as a sum of a sequence where each element is a power of k and all the numbers in the sequence are different.

Your **task** is to determine whether the number is mathematically beautiful.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
- The next T lines contain x and k denoting the numbers.

## Output format

For each test case, output "YES" if x is "mathematically beautiful" and "NO" otherwise.
