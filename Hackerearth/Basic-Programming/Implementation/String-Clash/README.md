# [String Clash][link]

You are given two strings S and T of equal lengths. You need to pick some characters from the first string, some from the second string and then form a new string by rearranging the characters you have picked. You need to find the length of the maximum string that you can make which will be a palindrome.

## Input format

The first line contains a string S as input and the next line contains a string T as input.

## Output format

In the output, you need to print an integer which denotes the maximum length of the palindrome that can be obtained.
