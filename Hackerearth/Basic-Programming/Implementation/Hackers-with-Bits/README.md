# Hackers with Bits

Hackers love bits, so does Alex. Alex has just started his career as hacker and found a special binary array A (containing and 0s and 1s).

In one operation, he can choose any two positions in the array, and can swap their values. He has to perform exactly one operation and maximize the length of the subarray containing only 1s.

**Note:** The positions can be different or same.

As Alex is a newbie in his field, help him for the same, and output the required length of the sub array containing only 1s.

## Input format

- First line consists of one integer N, denoting the number of elements in the array.
- Second line consists of N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.

## Output format

Print the required length of the sub array containing only 1s.
