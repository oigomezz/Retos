# [Diamonds][link]

Roman loved diamonds. Monica decided to give him a beautiful gift on Valentine's Day. Her idea of diamonds was different though. She lit up all the windows of her rectangular building with N floors and M windows on each floor, with 2 shapes - / or \ .

Given the shape of lights in all the windows, help Roman count the number of diamonds formed.

**Note:** The components of the diamond should be adjacent to each other.

## Input format

- First line contains T - the number of testcases.
- For each testcase:
  - First line contains 2 space-separated positive integers - N and M - the no. of floors in the building and the no. of windows on each floor respectively.
  - N lines follow - each line contains M space-separated characters. Every character is either or / .

## Output format

Print a single integer - the total no. of diamonds formed.
