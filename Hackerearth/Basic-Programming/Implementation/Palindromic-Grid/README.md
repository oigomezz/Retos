# [Palindromic Grid][link]

You are given a 2-d grid of N rows and M columns containing lower case alphabets only. You need to check whether it is possible to rearrange the complete grid so that each row and column becomes palindromic.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M, denoting the number of rows and columns.
