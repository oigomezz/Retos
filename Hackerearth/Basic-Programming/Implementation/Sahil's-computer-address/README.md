# [Sahil's computer address][link]

Given a String S, you need to report if the given String is a valid IP Address :

A valid IP address is:

1. It has exactly 4 non-empty parts separated by 3 dots, like: 255 [dot] 255 [dot] 255 [dot] 255
2. Decimal value of each part of the IP address should never exceed 255 and never be less than zero.

[dot] is written, instead of the .(dot) character for readability.

## Input format

The first and only line of input contains the string S. The string shall consist of only numbers and .(dot) symbol of ASCII character set only. All IP addresses will be in decimal i.e. base 10 notation only.

## Output format

Print the "YES" or "NO" answer on a single line.
