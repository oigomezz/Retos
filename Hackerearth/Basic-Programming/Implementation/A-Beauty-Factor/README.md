# [A Beauty Factor][link]

You are given a positive integer n. The beauty factor of a number is the sum of digits obtained till the obtained sum is a single digit.

- Beauty factor of 1987 = 1+9+8+7 = 25 = 2+5 = 7
- Beauty factor of 10 = 1+0 = 1

You are given a beauty factor, b. Your task is to find a minimum number (n) of length k whose beauty factor is b.

Here, the length of a number is defined as the number of digits a number has.

**Note:** The digits of the number in the output must be distinct and must be a positive integer

## Input format

- The first line contains the beauty factor b (0 < b < 10) and the length of a number k (0 < k < 10).

## Output format

Print the minimum number of length k whose beauty factor is b. If no such number is possible to make the beauty factor b with length k, then print -1.
