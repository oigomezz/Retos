# [Anti-Palindrome Strings][link]

You are given a string S containing only lowercase alphabets. You can swap two adjacent characters any number of times (including 0).

A string is called anti-palindrome if it is not a palindrome. If it is possible to make a string anti-palindrome, then find the lexicographically smallest anti-palindrome. Otherwise, print -1.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- Each line contains a string S of lower case alphabets only.

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer in a new line.
