# Number of Steps

You are given two arrays a1,a2,a3,...,an and b1,b2,b3,...,bn. In each step, you can set ai = ai - bi if ai >= bi. Determine the minimum number of steps that are required to make all a's equal.

## Input format

First line: n

Second line: a1,a2,a3,...,an.

Third line: b1,b2,b3,...,bn.

## Output format

Print the minimum number of steps that are required to make all a's equal. If it is not possible, then print -1.
