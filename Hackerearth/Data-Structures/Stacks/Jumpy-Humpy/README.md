# [Jumpy Humpy][link]

Humpy likes to jump from one building to another. But he only jumps to next higher building and stops when no higher building is available. Stamina required for a journey is xor of all the heights on which humpy jumps until he stops.

If heights are [1 2 4], and he starts from 1, goes to 2 stamina required is 1 ⊕ 2 = 3, then from 2 to 3. Stamina for the entire journey is 1 ⊕ 2 ⊕ 4 = 7. Find the maximum stamina required if can start his journey from any building.

## Input format

- First line: N, no of buildings.
- Second line: N integers, defining heights of buildings.

## Output format

Single Integer that is the maximum stamina required for any journey.
