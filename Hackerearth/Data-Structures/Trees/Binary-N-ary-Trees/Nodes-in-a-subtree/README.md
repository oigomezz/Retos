# Nodes in a subtree

You are given a rooted tree that contains N nodes. Each node contains a lowercase alphabet.

You are required to answer Q queries of type u,c where u is an integer and c is a lowercase alphabet. The count of nodes in the subtree of the node u containing c is considered as the answer of all the queries.

## Input format

- First line: Two space-separated integers N and Q respectively.
- Second line: A string s of length N (where the i-th character of s represents the character stored in node i).
- Next N-1 line: Two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between node u and node v.
- Next Q lines: An integer u and a space-separated character c.

## Output format

For each query, print the output in a new line.
