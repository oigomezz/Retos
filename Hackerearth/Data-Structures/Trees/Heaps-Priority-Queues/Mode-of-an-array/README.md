# Mode of an array

You are given an array of N numbers A1,A2,...,An. In one operation, you can pick any index i and change Ai to x. Given an integer K, find the minimum number of operations required to make K the mode of the array.

Note: A number is called the mode of the array if it is more frequent than any other number in the array.

Example: The mode of array [1,1,3] is 1. The array [1,1,3,3] does not have any mode.

## Input format

- The first line contains the number of test cases T.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers, N and K where N denotes the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains N integers A1,A2,...,An denoting the contents of the array.

## Output format

For each test case output a line containing the minimum number of operations required to make K the mode of array A.
