# [Operation Dilemma][link]

You are given 2 integers arrays A and B of size N, for every index i, you could either add Bi to Ai or subtract Bi from Ai, you are only allowed to do atmost K add operations. For a subarray of size L print the largest possible sum after doing the above operations.

## Input format

- The first line contains T, denoting the number of test cases.
- First line of each test case contains N,L,K denoting the size of the array, length of the subarray and the number of operations.
- Then the next line contains N integers, denoting the element of array A.
- Then the next line contains N integers, denoting the element of array B.

## Output format

Print a integer denoting the largest possible sum after doing the above operations.
