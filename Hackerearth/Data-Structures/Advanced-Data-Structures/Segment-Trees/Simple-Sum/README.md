# [Simple Sum][link]

You have been given an array of N integers a1,a2,...,an. You have to find simple sum for this array. Simple Sum is defined as ΣΣ max(a[i], a[i+1], ...,a[j]) \* (a[i]|a[j]). | denotes the bitwise OR operator.

## Input format

- First line of input consists of integer N.
- Next line of input consists of N integers a1,a2,...,an.

## Output format
