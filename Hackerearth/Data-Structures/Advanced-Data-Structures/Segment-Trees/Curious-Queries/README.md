# Curious Queries

You are given an array A of length N. You are asked Q queries. Each query is of the form L,R and the answer is the sum of A[i] for all i such that 0 <= i <= L and A[i] > A[R].

Print an array B of length Q such that B[i] is the answer to the ith query.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains a single integer T, which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers N and Q, denoting the length of the array A and the number of queries, respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains N integers, denoting the array A.
- The following Q lines of each test case contains two integers L,R denoting each query.

## Output format

For each test case, print an array A of length Q separated by space such that B[i] is the answer to the ith query in a new line.
