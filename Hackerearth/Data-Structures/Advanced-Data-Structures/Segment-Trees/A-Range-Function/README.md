# [A range function][link]

You are given an array A of N integer elements.

You are also given Q queries where each query is one of the following types:

- 1 i val: Update value of element at i-th index to val i.e. A[i] = val
- 2 L R: Find the value of function ΣΣΣ A[k].

**Note:** Assume 1-based indexing.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T that denotes the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer N.
  - The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting array A.
  - The third line contains an integer Q.
  - Next Q lines contain three space-separated integers denoting the queries.

## Output format

For each test case, print the value of the function for queries of type 2 in the new line.
