# [Counting the number of intervals][link]

You are given a sequence of N integers a1,a2,...,an and an integer K. Your task is to count the number of intervals [L,R] such that a[L] + a[R] + min(a[L], a[L+1],...,a[R]) <= K.

## Input format

- First line: Two space-separated integers N,K.
- Second line: N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the sequence.

## Output format

Print the answer in a single line.
