# [Equal subarrays][link]

You are given an array of N non-negative integers [A1, A2,..., An], and a non-negative integer K. A subarray is an array composed of a contiguous block of original array elements. You can perform the following operation on a subarray:

Increase each element of this subarray by a non-negative number such that the total sum of all the increments does not exceed K. You must make all the elements of this subarray equal.

Determine the maximum length of a subarray in which all the elements can be made equal by performing the mentioned operation.

## Input format

- First line: An integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.
- Second line: An integer K.
- Third line: N space-separated integers where Ai denotes the elements of the array

## Output format

Print the maximum length of a subarray in which all the elements can be made equal by performing the operation.
