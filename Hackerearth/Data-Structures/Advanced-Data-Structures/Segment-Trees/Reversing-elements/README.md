# [Reversing elements][link]

You are given an array A of size N and Q queries. For each query, you are given two indices of the array L and R. The subarray generated from L to R is reversed. Your task is to determine the maximum sum of the subarrays.

**Note:** After each query is solved, the array comes to its initial states.

## Input format

- First line: Two space-separated integers N and Q
- Next line: N space-separated integers denoting the array elements.
- Next Q lines: Two space-separated integers in every line denoting the values of L and R

## Output format

For each query, print the required answer in a new line.
