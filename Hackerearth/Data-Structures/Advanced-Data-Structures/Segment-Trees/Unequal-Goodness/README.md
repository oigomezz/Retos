# Unequal Goodness

You are given an array A of N integers. A subarray from L to R (L < R) is good if A[L] != A[R].

You have to find the maximum possible sum of elements of a good subarray. If there is no such good subarray then print "Not Possible".

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains N.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum possible sum of elements of good subarray or print "Not Possible" (without double quotes) if there is no such good subarray.
