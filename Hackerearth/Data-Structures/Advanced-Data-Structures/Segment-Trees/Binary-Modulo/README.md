# [Binary Modulo][link]

You are given a Binary String A of length N indexed from 0 to N-1. You have to perform 2 queries:

1. 0 L R - Tell the remainder of Number(in Decimal) represented by the Binary String between indexes L and R when divided by 5.
2. 1 X V - Replace character at position X with V.

## Input format

- First line contains T which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains the binary string A.
- The next line contains Q which is the number of queries.
- Next Q lines contain the description of queries which may be of either of the 2 types as described in the problem statement.

## Output format

For each query of Type 0, print the answer in a single line.
