# [Big Number Array][link]

Given an array of n integers. Initially, all elements are zero. You are asked to complete q queries of two kinds:

- 1 x y l r: for each i in range [x, y] flip the l-th bit to r-bit of i-th element.
- 2 x y: check if x-th element equals y-th element.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follow:
- A line contains two space-separated integers n, q denoting the size of array and the number of queries. q queries follow are described as in the statement.

## Output format

For each query of kind 2, output a single line contains "YES" if two numbers are equal, otherwise "NO".
