# Length of arithmetic progressions

You are given an integer array A of size N. You are also given Q queries. In each query, you are given three integers L, R, and D respectively.

You are required to determine the length of the largest contiguous segment in the indices range [L,R] of A that forms an arithmetic progression with a common difference of D.

**Note:** The segment whose length is 1 always forms an arithmetic progression of a common difference D.

## Input format

- First line: Two space-separated integers N and Q respectively.
- Second line: N space-separated integers denoting elements of A.
- Next Q lines: Three space-separated integers L, R, and D respectively

## Output format

Print Q lines representing the answer such as the i-th line denotes the answer for the i-th query.
