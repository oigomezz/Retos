# [Distinct Integers in Range][link]

You are given two arrays A and B each of length N. Now you are given Q queries. In each query, you are given two pairs of ranges i.e. a range [a,b] in the array A and range [c,d] in the array B. For each query, you need to count distinct elements in the array which is formed by combining elements of the both the ranges in the query.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer N as input.
- Next line contains N space separated integers that denote elements of the array A.
- Next line contains N space separated integers that denote elements of the array B.
- Next line contains an integer Q that denotes the total number of queries.
- Next lines Q contain A integers each i.e. a,b,c and d.

## Output format

For each query, you need to print the output in a new line.
