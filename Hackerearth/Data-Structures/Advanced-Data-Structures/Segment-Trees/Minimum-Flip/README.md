# [Minimum Flip][link]

You are given an array of N numbers.

An operation on the array is defined as :

Select a non-empty subarray of the array and a number j. Now flip the j-th bit of all the elements of this subarray.

Output the minimum sum of the elements of the given array that can be obtained after doint the above operation at most
times.

## Input format

- The first line contains two integers N and K(1<= N <= 10⁵, 1<= K <= 10⁹), denoting the number of elements in the array and the maximum number of operations allowed.
- The second line contains N integers a1,a2,...,an (1<= a[i] <= 10⁶), the elements of the array.

## Output format

Output the minimum sum of elements that can be obtained by applying the operation at most K times.
