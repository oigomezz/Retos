# Unique Gems

Rahul has entered into a mysterious land of gems. There is a record S for each of the gems that is maintained in form of a string. Each gem is characterized by some substring of this string. Interestingly, the number of occurrences of a sub-string in S is the exact number of such gems present in the land.

However, Rahul is only interested in unique gems. Please tell the number of such sub-strings that occur exactly once.
