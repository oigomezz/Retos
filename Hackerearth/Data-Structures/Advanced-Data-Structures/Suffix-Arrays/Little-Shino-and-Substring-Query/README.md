# [Little Shino and Substring Query][link]

Given N words and Q queries. Each query will have a string. You have to print two integers. Index of lexicographical smallest and largest string that contains the query string as substring. If there are multiple lexicographical smallest string, print the smallest index. If there are multiple lexicographical largest string, print the largest index. If there is no word that contains the query string as substring, print 1.

**Note:** Consider 0-indexing.

## Input format

- First line will contains two integers, N and Q.
- Next line contains N space separated words, W.
- Next Q lines contain a string S each. Sum of lengths of all the words is less than or equal to 10⁶. Sum of lengths of all the query strings (sum(|S|)) is less than or equal to 2 \* 10⁷.

## Output format

Print the index of lexicographical smallest and largest string that contains the string S as substring.
