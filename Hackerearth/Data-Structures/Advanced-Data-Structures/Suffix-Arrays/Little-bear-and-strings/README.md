# [Little bear and strings][link]

Little bear has got a big string S as his birthday present. Also, he personally loves all those strings that start with T1 and end with T2, and calls them good. Now, he would like most the birthday present has maximum number of good substrings. Also, he is not the kind of "bear"(:P) that would easily get fooled by substrings with different start and end positions. He would only count a string once, irrespective of its number of occurrences. More formally, he wants to determine the number of distinct good substrings.

## Input format

The input file contains multiple test cases that end with EOF. Each test case comprises of 3 lines each containing S, T1 and T2 respectively.

## Output format

Output the required answer in a new line for every test case.
