# Swapping numbers

You are given a permutation p1,p2,...,pn of numbers from 1 to n.

A permutation p1,p2,...,pn, beauty, is defined as the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to sort the permutation.

If it is allowed to swap two elements of the permutation (not necessarily adjacent) at most once, then what is the minimum beauty that you can get?

## Input format

- The first line contains n.
- The second line contains the space-separated permutation p1,p2,...,pn.

## Output format

Print an integer denoting the minimum ugliness that we can get.
