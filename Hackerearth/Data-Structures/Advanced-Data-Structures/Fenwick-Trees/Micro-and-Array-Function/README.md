# [Micro and Array Function][link]

Micro has made a breakthrough. He made a function which he proudly calls Micro's Array Fucntion. It takes an array of integers A and an integer K as input and optimally finds out the number of unordered pairs (i,j), i != j such that |A[i] - A[j]| >= K.

Micro is getting a lot of recognition because of it. His best friend Mike wants to be a part of it, but for that he needs to make some contribution. He thought of extending Micro's Array function. He wants to make a new function g(A,K) that also takes an array of integers A and an integer K as input and optimally calculates Î£ f(X,K) for all contiguous subarrays X of A. He need your help in this and help here means do the entire task. He'll give you an integer K and an array A having N integers and you need to compute g(A,K).

## Input format

- First line consists of a single integers T denoting the number of test cases.
- First line of each test case consists of two space separated integer denoting N and K.
- Second line of each test case consists of a N space separated integers denoting the array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the value of g(A,K) in a new line.
