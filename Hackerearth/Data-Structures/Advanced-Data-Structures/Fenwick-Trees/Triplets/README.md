# [Triplets][link]

You are given an integer n and two arrays each of which is a permutation of numbers from 1to n.

**Task** Your task is to determine the number of unordered triplets (a,b,c) such that the relative ordering of (a,b,c) is the same in both the arrays.

**Function description** Complete the countTriplet function provided in the editor. The function takes the following 3 parameters and returns the number of ordered triplets.

- n: Represents the length of the permutation
- A: Represents the first permutation of numbers from 1 to n
- B: Represents the second permutation of numbers from 1 to n

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T also denotes the number of times you have to run the countTriplet function on a different set of inputs.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains a single integer n.
  - Each of the next two lines contains n space-separated integers denoting the permutations of numbers from 1 to n.

## Output format

For each test case, print the number of ordered triplets in a new line.
