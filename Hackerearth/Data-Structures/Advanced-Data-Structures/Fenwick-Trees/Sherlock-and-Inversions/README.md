# [Sherlock and Inversions][link]

Watson gives to Sherlock an array of N integers denoted by A1, A2 ... AN.

Now he gives him Q queries of form Li, Ri. For each such query Sherlock has to report the number of inversions in subarray denoted by [Li, Ri].

Inversions in a subarray denoted by [a, b] are number of pairs (i, j) such that a ≤ i < j ≤ b and Ai > Aj.

## Input format

- First line contains N and Q. Next line contains N space separated integers denoting array A.
- Each of the next Q lines contain two space separated integers denoting Li, Ri.

## Output format

For each query, print the required answer in one line.
