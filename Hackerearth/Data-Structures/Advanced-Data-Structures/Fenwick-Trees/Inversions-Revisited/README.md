# [Inversions Revisited][link]

Most of us know how to count the number of inversions in an array. An inversion in an array is a pair of indices(i,j) such that a[i] > a[j] and i < j.

In this problem you are given 2 arrays A and B and you have to return number of such pairs such that a[i] > b[j] and i < j.

## Input format

- First line contains n denoting the total number of elements.
- The next line contains n space separated integers of array A.
- This line is again followed by n space separated integers of array B.

## Output format

Print the total number of pairs satisfying the above condition.
