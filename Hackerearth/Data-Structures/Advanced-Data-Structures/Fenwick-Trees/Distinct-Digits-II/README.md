# [Distinct Digits II][link]

Andi and Bob are the best friends of each other.They both are good programmers as well,They like to do programming together so that if one finds any difficulty other can help.But these days Andi is quite busy as his exams are on the way . So, Bob has to do programming alone.while practising on HackerEarth Bob encounters an interesting problem which he was unable to solve efficiently.So, he asked for Andi's help.

Problem as stated by Bob :

Given an array of N elements and Q queries need to be processed over this array.A query can be any of the following three types.

- Type ADD: u v
- Type MUL: u v
- Type REP: u v
- Type MAX: l r
- Type MIN: l r

## Input format

- First line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.
- Next line of input contains N space seperated integers.
- Third line of input contains a single interger Q denoting the number of queries to be processed over the array.
- Next Q lines of input contain Q queries (one query per line).

## Output format

For each query of type MIN and MAX print two space seperated integers number of distinct digits and number of such numbers.
