# [Mojtabas Trees and Arpas Queries][link]

Mojtaba has two trees, each of them has n vertices. Arpa has q queries, each in type v, u, x, y. Let s be the set of vertices in the path from v to u in the first tree and p be the set of vertices in the path from x to y in the second tree. Mojtaba has to calculate the size of s ∩ p for each query.

## Input format

- The first line of input will contain two integers, n, q.
- The next n - 1 lines will contain edges of the first tree.
- The next n - 1 lines will contain edges of the second tree.
- The next q lines contain queries.

## Output format

For each query, let s be the set of vertices in the path from v to u in the first tree and be p the set of vertices in the path from x to y in the second tree, print the size of s ∩ p for each query.
