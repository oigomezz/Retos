Andi and Bob are best friends. They both are good programmers as well. They love programming together because if one of them gets stuck on some problem other can help. But these days Andi is quite busy as his exams are approaching. So, Bob has to tackle the problems alone. While practicing on HackerEarth Bob encounters an interesting problem which he was unable to solve efficiently. So, he asked Andi for help.

Problem as stated by Bob :

Given an array of N elements, Q queries need to be processed over this array. A query can be of any of the following three types:

- Type 0: u v
- Type 1: u v
- Type 2: l r c

## Input format

- First line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.
- Next line of the input contains N space separated integers.
- Third line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries to be processed over the array.
- Next Q lines of input contain Q queries (one query per line).

## Output format

For each query of type 2 print the desired answer.
