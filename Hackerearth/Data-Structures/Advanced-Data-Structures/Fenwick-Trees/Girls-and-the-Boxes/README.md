# [Girls and the Boxes][link]

You are given n boxes and each box contains two small boxes of Red and Blue color. The size of the Red and Blue colored boxes are b[i] and r[i] respectively.

Consider a sequence of distinct integers x1,x2,...,xk (1<= xi <= n).

Consider x to be a suitable sequence if, for every 1 <= i < k holds b[xi] < r[xi+1] and r[xi] < b[xi +1].

Determine the maximum possible size of the suitable sequence.

## Input format

- First line: n representing the number of available boxes.
- Next n lines: Two positive integers r[i] and b[i]

## Output format

Print only one integer representing the size of the maximum suitable sequence.
