# Shil and Special Pairs

Shil has a permutation p1, p2, ..., pN of numbers from 1 to N and M queries. Each query consists of two integers l and r. Answer to each query is total number of pairs[i , j] such that l ≤ i ≤ j ≤ r and|pi - pj| ≤ D.

## Input format

- First line consists of three integers N, M and D.
- Next line consists of permutation p1 , p2 .. pN of the first N natural numbers.
- Next M lines consists of two integers l and r.

## Output format

Output M integers with i-th integer corresponding answer to i-th query.
