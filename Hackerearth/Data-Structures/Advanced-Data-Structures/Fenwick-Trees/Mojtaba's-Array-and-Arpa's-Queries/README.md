# Mojtaba's Array and Arpa's Queries

Mojtba has an array a with n elements and an integer k. Arpa has q query in type [L,R], for i-th query print the length of the shortest segment [x,y] ∈ [L,R], such that k∏a[j].

## Input format

- The first line of input will contain three integers, n,k,q.
- Next line will contain n integers a1,a2,...,an - integers of the array a.
- In i-th line of the next q lines, two integers given, Li,Ri.

## Output format

For each query print the length of the shortest segment [x,y] ∈ [L,R], such that k∏a[j]. If there is no segment satisfying the condition, print -1.
