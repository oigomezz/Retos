# [Power of String][link]

For a given integer K and a string S of length N, we denote power of S, as the length of a longest substring occurring in S at least K times.

Given K and S, find the power of S.

## Input format

- In the first line there are two integers K and N separated by a single space.
- The second line constains string S itself.

## Output format

In one line, output the power of string S for a given K.
