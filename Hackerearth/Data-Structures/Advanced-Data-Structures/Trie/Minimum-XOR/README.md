You are given q queries of two types:

1. 1 X: Append value X into an array.
2. 2 X K: You are required to print the Kth minimum XOR of X with the current array. You have to make a new array whose ith element is current_array[i]. Then sort it and print the Kth element.

## Input format

- The first line contains q.
- Next q lines contain the types of queries. (1 or 2)
  - If type is 1, then it contains X.
  - If type is 2, then it contains X and K.
