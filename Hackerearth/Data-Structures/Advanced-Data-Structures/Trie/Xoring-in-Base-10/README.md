# Xoring in Base 10

Given two numbers A = (A0A1...An) and B = (B0B1...Bn) in base 10, we define the xor of A and B as A \* B = (X0X1...Xn), where Xi = (Ai + Bi) mod 10.

Little Achraf has an array S of integers in base 10 and he was asked by his professor Toman to find the maximum number he can get by xoring exactly k numbers.

## Input format

- First line contains two integers n and k, denoting the number elements in the sequence, and the number of integers you have to xor.
- Next line contains n integers.

## Output format

Output a single integer denoting the answer of the problem in base 10.
