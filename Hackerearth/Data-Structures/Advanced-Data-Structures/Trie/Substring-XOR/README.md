# [Substring XOR][link]

Given a length-n array a and a number k, there are (n(n+1))/2 subarrays in total. For each subarray, we can compute the xor sum of its elements.

In this problem, we will sort all these xor-sums in non-increasing order. And we want to find the kth element.

## Input format

- The first line contains two numbers n and k.
- The second line contains n numbers.

## Output format

Output the kth element in the non-increasing order.
