# Cost of Data

Strings can be efficiently stored as a data structure, to have efficient searching methods.

A new startup is going to use this method, but they don't have much space. So they want to check beforehand how much memory will be required for their data.

Following method describes the way in which this startup's engineers save the data in the structure.

Suppose they have 5 strings/words: et,eq,bd,be,bdp

A empty node is kept NULL, and strings are inserted into the structure one by one.

## Input format

- First line contains N, the number of strings they have.
- Each of the next N lines contain one string. Each string consists only of lowercase letters.

## Output format

Print the required number of nodes.
