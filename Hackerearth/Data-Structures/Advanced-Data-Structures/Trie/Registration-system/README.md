# Registration system

Your task is to write a registration system.

The system works in the following way. Every user has a preferred login li. System finds the first free login considering possible logins in the following order: li, li0, li1, li2, ... , li10, li11, ... (you check li first; in case it is occupied already, you pick smallest nonnegative integer x such that concatenation of li and decimal notation of x gives you free login) and register a user with this login in the system. After the registration this login becomes occupied.

You gave the preferred logins for the n users in chronological order. For each user you have to find a login which he will use in the system.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains a single integer n - a number of users.
- Then follow n lines. The i-th of these lines contains li - a preferred login for i-th user. li is a nonempty string with lowercase english letters and digits.
- Guaranteed that the sum of lengths of li is not greater than 10‚Å∂.

## Output format

Print n lines. The i-th of these lines should contain an occupied login for the i-th user.
