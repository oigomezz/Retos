# [Ma5termind and XOR Minimization][link]

Mastermind is a bright student of his class. To judge his intellegence and speed his teacher has given him a question and he needs your help for solving it. The question is :

Given a sequence of N elements, find all subsequences of this sequence, then compute sum of all these subsequences individually, finally, find the number of subsequences which give minimum XOR with a given value A. He can solve this question very quickly but now he needs your help as the number of such questions is very large.

## Input format

First line of the input contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the sequence. Next line of the input contains N space separated integers. Next line of the input contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries. Next Q lines of input contains a single integer denoting the value of A.

## Output format

Output consists of Q lines each containing two integers. First integer denotes the sum of the elements in the chosen subsequence and second integer denotes the number of such subsequences.
