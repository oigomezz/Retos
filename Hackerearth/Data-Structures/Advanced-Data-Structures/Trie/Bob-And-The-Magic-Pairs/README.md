# [Bob And The Magic Pairs][link]

Bob is a brilliant student in the class, so his teacher assigned him a problem. He has been given an array A containing N positive integers and two integers U and V. He has been asked to find the number of magic pairs of array indices.

A pair of integers (i,j) is called a magic pair if i < j and U <= A[i] ^ A[j] <= V where ^ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

Help Bob to find the number of magic pairs in the given array.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains the integers N, U, and V separated by spaces.
- The second line of each test case contains N spaced integers, the elements of the array.

## Output format

For each test case, print the number of magic pairs in the given array.
