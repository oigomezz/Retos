# Count Tuples

You are given an array A having N integers. Find the number of triplets (i,j,k) such that

- 1 <= i < j < k <= N.
- The integer A[j] is equal to the median of the integers A[i], A[j], A[k].

The median of three integers is the middle element after sorting the three integers. For example, the median of (5,1,3) is 3, (2,4,4) is 4.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows:
  - The first line of each test case contains an integers N.
  - The second line of each test case contains N integers A1,A2,...,An.

## Output format

For each test case, print the number of triplets that satisfies the given conditions in a separate line.
