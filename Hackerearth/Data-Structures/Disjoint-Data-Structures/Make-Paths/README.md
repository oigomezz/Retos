# [Make Paths][link]

Walter White and Jesse Pinkman have now established their bases at different places.

Now they want to form a network, that is, they want that all their bases should be reachable from every base.

One base is reachable from other base if there is a path of tunnels connecting bases.

Bases are suppose based on a 2-D plane having integer coordinates.

Cost of building tunnels between two bases are coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) is min{ |x1-x2|, |y1-y2| }.

What is the minimum cost such that a network is formed.

## Input format

- First line contains N, the number of bases.
- Each of the next N lines contain two integers xi and yi.

## Output format

Print the minimum cost of building the network.
