# [Group Range][link]

You are given N integers. You are required to perform Q queries. In each query, you are given two integers x and y. Your task is to merge the groups that contain the x-th and y-th integer to a single group. After performing each query, you are required to print the range of numbers that lie in the newly-formed group. Initially, the numbers do not belong to any group.

## Input format

- First line: N denoting the number of integers.
- Next line: N space-separated integers denoting N integers.
- Next line: Q denoting the number of queries.
- Next Q lines: Integers x and y.

## Output format

For every query, print two space-separated integers min and max in a new line, where min is the minimum element and max is the maximum element of the new group formed.
