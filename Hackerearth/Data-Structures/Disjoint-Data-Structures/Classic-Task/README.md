# [Classic task][link]

Given an undirected graph with n vertices. There are m sets of edges in this graph, the i-th set is represented by 2 integers (l[i], r[i]) meaning that there are edges (l[i], r[i]), (l[i]+1, r[i]-1), ... , (r[i], l[i]) in the graph.

Find the number of connected components in this graph.

## Input format

- The first line contains 2 integers - n, m.
- The next m lines contain 2 integers - l[i], r[i].

## Output format

Output the number of connected components in the graph.
