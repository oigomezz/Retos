# [City and Campers 2][link]

The campers turn against Alex after joining together!

Alex has split into N parts, and each of these N parts is wandering around the city aimlessly. You have to handle Q queries; which consist of two groups of Alex's finding each other and becoming one larger group. After each query, output the minimum difference between two groups. If there is only one group, output 0. At first, everyone is in their own group. What this means is that there are N groups, each of which contain 1 part of Alex.

Also note, if the two Alex's in the query are already in the same group, print the current answer, and skip merging the groups together.

## Input format

- The first line consists of two space separated integers, N and Q.
- The next Q line consists of two integers, A and B, meaning that the groups involving Alex A and Alex B find each other.

## Output format

Output Q lines, the answer after each query.
