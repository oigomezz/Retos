# [Two types of queries][link]

You are given a string str. It costs one unit of a coin to change a character at an index. Your task is to convert it into a palindrome with minimum coins. Also, you are given q number of queries. The queries are of the following types:

- 1 A B
- 2

After solving the first type of query, you can convert character A into character B without any cost and vice versa. In the second type of query, you are required to answer the minimum cost that is required to convert the given string into a palindrome.

**Note:** If character A can be converted to character B and character B can be converted to character C, then you can convert character A to character C.

## Input format

- The first line contains n denoting the length of the string.
- The second line contains string str.
- The third line contains q that denotes the number of queries.
- The next q lines contain one of the mentioned queries.

## Output format

For each query of type 2, print the minimum cost to convert a given string into a palindrome.
