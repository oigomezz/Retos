# [ICPC Team Management][link]

Little Chandan is an exceptional manager - apart from his role in HackerEarth - as the person who has to bug everyone, in general... and if possible, try to get some work done.

He's also offered a job as the coach of the best Russian teams participating for ACM-ICPC World Finals. Now, Chandan is an extremely good coach, too. But he's a weird person who thrives on patterns in life, in general. So, he has decided that if there are n number of students in total, and he is supposed to divide them in camps of k students - he want them to be arranged in such a way that the length of names of all the students in a camp is equal.

I know, totally weird, right?

## Input format

The first line will contain the number of test cases. Which will be followed by two integers, n, k - denoting the number of total students, and the number of total students which will be allowed in one camp. After which, n lines will follow denoting the names of all the students who're willing to learn by the great coach.

## Output format

If it is possible for all the students be arranged in a camp of k students, print "Possible", else print "Not possible".
