# [Shubham and Subarrays][link]

You are given an array consisting of n integer numbers a1,a2,...,an. Two subarrays [l1,r1] (1 <= l1 < r1 <= n) and [l2,r2] (1 <= l2 < r2 <= n) are considered the same if they have the same "special set" of numbers. Output the number of distinct subarrays.
Note: A "special set" of numbers is a set of unique numbers sorted in increasing order.For example,the "special set" corresponding to the numbers [5,2,7,2,5,9] is [2,5,7,9].

## Input format

- First line contains n denoting the number of array elements.
- Second line contains n integers denoting a1,a2,...,an.

## Output format

Output the required answer.
