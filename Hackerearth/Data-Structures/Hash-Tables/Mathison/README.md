# [Mathison and the divisible trios][link]

Mathison has discovered an old piece of paper with N integers written on it. Let's call this given sequence of numbers A. In his History class, Mathison has learnt that a trio of numbers is special if and only if their sum is divisible by a mythical constant M.

Mathison tries to find out how many distinct triplets of numbers, from the piece of paper, have their sum divisible by M. Unfortunately, this problem is quite hard to crack and he needs your help.

## Input format

- The first line of the input file contains two space-separated integers, N and M, representing the number of integers and the mythical constant.
- The next line contains N space-separated integers, where the i-th integer represents A[i].

## Output format

The output file should contain only one integer, the answer to Mathison's question.
