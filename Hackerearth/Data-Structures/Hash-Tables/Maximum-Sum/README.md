# Maximum Sum

Given an array A of N integers. Now, you have to output the sum of unique values of the maximum subarray sum of all the possible subarrays of the given array A.

**Note:** Subarray means contiguous elements with atleast one element in it.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains a single integer N, the total number of elements in array A.
- The next line of the input contains N space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

## Output format

The only single line of the output should contain a single integral value representing the answer to the problem.
