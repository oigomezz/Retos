# Valid pairs

A famous Italian restaurant allows guests to enter only if they are present in pairs and the sum of the wealth of the people of the pair is a power of 3. A group of people wants to eat at the restaurant. Mathematically, if there are two people of wealth a and b, it forms a valid pair if a + b = 3^k for some positive integer k. They want to know how many possible pairs would be allowed entry.

**Task** Given the individual wealth of the people, find the number of valid pairs.

- One person can be in multiple valid pairs.
- A pair of person X and Y is the same as a pair of person Y and X.
