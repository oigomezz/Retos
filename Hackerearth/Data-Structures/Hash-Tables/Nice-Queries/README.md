# [Nice Queries][link]

You are given an array A of length N which is initialised with 0. You will be given Q queries of two types:

1. **k:** set value 1 at index k in array A
2. **y:** print the smallest index x which is greater than or equal to y and having value 1. If there is no such index print 1.

**Note:** Indexing is 1 based.

## Input format

- First line contains two integers N and Q separated by a space.
- The next Q lines contain the type of query (i.e. either a 1 or a 2), then a space, then for type 1 queries integer k and for type 2 queries integer y.

## Output format

For each query type 2, print in new line, the smallest index x which is greater than or equal to y and having value 1. If there is no such index print 1.
