# Similar Chocolates

There are N chocolates denoted by array A where A[i] is the length of the i-th chocolate. Alice can melt each chocolate and then convert it into a chocolate whose length is any divisor of the number A[i]. So, a chocolate of length A[i] can be converted into X different types of chocolate where is the count of divisors of the number A[i]. So you need to count the total unordered pair of chocolates such that their X value is same.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer N as input denoting the total number of elements in the array A.
- The next line contains N space-separated integers that denote the elements of the array A.

## Output format

In the output, print the total number of ways as mentioned in the statement.
