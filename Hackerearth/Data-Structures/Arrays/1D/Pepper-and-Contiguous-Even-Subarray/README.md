You have an array of length N. A subarray is called Interesting if it contains only even numbers. You have to find the maximum length of such Interesting subarray.

You are given a code which does the given task but has some bugs (errors). You have to make changes in the given function such that the code handles all the cases for errors and generate correct output every time.

## Input format

- First line contains T , denoting number of test cases.
- Each test case contains two lines:
  - First line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array.
  - Second line contains N space seperated integers denoting the value of array elements.

## Output format
