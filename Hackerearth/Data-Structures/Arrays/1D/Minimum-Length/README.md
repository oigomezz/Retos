# Minimum Length

You are given two arrays A and B, of length N. You can select any subarray and then sort the elements in ascending order of that subarray for arrays A and B.

Find the minimum length of the subarray you can choose to make A and B same after performing the operation. A and B are permutations of each other.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
- The next line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, elements of array A.
- The next line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, elements of array B.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum length of the subarray you can choose to make A and B same after performing the operation.
