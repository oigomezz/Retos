# [Non-empty subsets][link]

You are given an array A consisting of N non-negative integers. Find out the minimum number K such that there exists a non-empty subset of A for which the bitwise OR of all its elements is equal to K.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in array A.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers of array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print a line containing the minimum possible value of K.
