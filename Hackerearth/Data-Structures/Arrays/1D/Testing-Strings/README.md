# [Testing Strings][link]

Mr X and Mr Y, his friend are programmers and testers respectively working in the same company. So, once they faced the following scenario :

Mr X wrote an application that took as input some user data. The data the application took as input was a string in some strange language. That language consisted of K distinct letters. However, due to some issues, the application got corrupted and one particular String among many was lost.

However, Mr X had seen that String once before it got lost. He remembers some info about it. Particu-larly, he remembers the lost String had length equal to M.

Mr Y, being the chief QA person in his company needs to try and figure out the number of possible different possible candidate Strings for the lost String.

Mr X remembers N pieces of info. For each one, he gives you 2 numbers L and R and a number Z. He remembers for sure that the Zth letter of the language of the string did not occur between positions L and R inclusive of the lost String.

## Input format

- The first line contains 3 space separated integers N ,M and K.
- Each of the next N contains 3 space separated integers, denoting L , R and Z respectively.

## Output format

You need to find and print the number of different possible candidate Strings for the lost String based on the info Mr X remembers. As the number of such Strings can be large, print it Modulo 10‚Å∂ + 3.
