# [Unique Subarrays][link]

A contiguous subarray is defined as unique if all the integers contained within it occur exactly once. There is a unique weight associated with each of the subarray. Unique weight for any subarray equals it's length if it's unique, 0 otherwise. Your task is to calculate the sum of unique weights of all the contiguous subarrays contained within a given array.

## Input format

First line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of testcases. 2 \* T lines follow, where first line of each testcase contains an integer N denoting the number of integers in the given array. Last line of each testcase then contains N single space separated integers

## Output format

Print the summation of unique weights of all the subarrays for each testcase in a separate line.
