# [Pairs Having Similar Elements][link]

Given an array, A, having N integers A1,A2,...,An.Two elements of the array Ai and Aj are called similar iff Ai = Aj + 1 or Aj = Ai + 1.

Also, the similarity follows transitivity. If Ai and Aj are similar and Aj and Ak are similar, then Ai and Ak are also similar.

**Note:** i, j, and k are all distinct.

You need to find number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i < j and Ai is similar to Aj.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer N denoting number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains N space separated integers where ith elements indicate Ai.

## Output format

Output the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i < j and Ai is similar to Aj in a single line.
