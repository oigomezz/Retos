# [Thief and Warehouses][link]

There are N warehouses. The warehouses are located in a straight line and are indexed from 1 to N. Each warehouse contains some number of sacks.

A thief decides to rob these warehouses. Thief figured out that he can escape the police if and only if he follows both the following 2 constraints:

- He will rob only one continuous segment of warehouses.
- He will rob same number of sacks from each warehouse.

Thief wants to calculate the maximum number of sacks he can steal without getting caught by the police.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting number test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting number of warehouses.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers : a[1],a[2],...,a[n]. a[i] denotes number of sacks in ith warehouse.

## Output format

Print the answer to each test case in a new line.
