# [Large Sub-Arrays][link]

You are given an array A with size N and two integers M and K.
Let's define another array B with size N x M as the array that's formed by concatenating M copies of array A.

You have to find the number of sub-arrays of the array B with sum <= K. Since the answer can be very large you have to print the answer mod 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers N and M and K.
- Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the array elements.

## Output format

For each test case, print the required answer in a new line.
