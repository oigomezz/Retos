# [Permutations][link]

You are given a permutation with length n . You want to play a game with you friend, Bob, and the rule will be as follows:

- You will choose a subarray [l,r] from the permutation. Then, ask Bob to find the maximum element in the rest of the numbers.

You are given a permutation a contains all numbers 1 to n. And, in q queries, each query has two integers l and r.

For each query, you have to help Bob find the maximum value that does not exist in the subarray [l,r].

**Note:** A permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n of length containing each number exactly once.

For example, (1), (4, 3, 5, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1) are permutations and (1, 1), (4, 3, 1), (2, 3, 4) are not.

## Input format

- The first line contains two integers n and q denoting the number of elements and the number of test cases.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers.
- The next q lines and each line contains two integers l, r.

## Output format

Print the maximum number that does not exist in the subarray [l,r].
