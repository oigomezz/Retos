# [Maximize the modulo function][link]

You are given an integer N that is represented in the form of string S of length M. You can remove at most 1 digit from the number after removing the rest of the digits that are arranged in the same order.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers M and K.
- The second line of each test case contains string S.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum possible value of the mod function in a new line.
