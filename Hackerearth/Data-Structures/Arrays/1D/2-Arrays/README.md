# [2 arrays][link]

You are given 2 arrays A and B, each of the size N. Each element of these arrays is either a positive integer or -1. The total number of -1's that can appear over these 2 arrays are >= 1 and <= 2.

Now, you need to find the number of ways in which we can replace each -1 with a non-negative integer, such that the sum of both of these arrays is equal.

## Input format

- First line: An integer N.
- Second line: N space-separated integers, where the of these denotes A[i].
- Third line: N space-separated integers, where the of these denotes B[i].

## Output format

If there exists a finite number X, then print it. If the answer is not a finite integer, then print 'Infinite'.
