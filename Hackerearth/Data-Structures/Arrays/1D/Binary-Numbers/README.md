You are given a set of binary elements. You have to eliminate the binary numbers that contain 11 as a substring. The resultant sequence will be 1, 10, 100, 101, 1000, and so on.

You are required to generate the code to determine the Kth value of the new sequence.

## Input format

- First line: T denoting the number of test cases.
- Next T lines: A single integer K.

## Output format

Print T lines representing the code to display the Kth value.
