# [Largest Square][link]

You are given N points on the infinite 2D plane. You need to find 4 such points among these N points, such that, they form a square with positive side length and whose sides are parallel to the x and y axis.

If there are multiple choices of 4 such points, choose those which form the square of largest side. If there are still multiple choices of 4 such points, choose those 4 points in which the bottom left point has a lower y co-ordinate. If there are still multiple choices of 4 such points, choose those 4 points in which the bottom left point has a lower x co-ordinate.

## Input format

First line contains a single integer N, denoting the number of points on the 2D plane. Each of the next N lines contain 2 space separated integers X and Y, these denote the x and y co-ordinates of the point.

## Output format

Print 2 space separated integers, the co-ordinates of the bottom left point of the square found. If there are no squares present, print -1.
