# [Gift for Almas][link]

On his birthday, Almas was given a n x n (1 <= n <= 500) matrix of natural numbers up to 500 and instructions for it. The instruction consisted of symbols L and R, where if the symbol L is given you need to rotate the matrix 90 degrees to the left, and for the symbol R you need to rotate the matrix 90 degrees to the right. The instruction was only 3 characters in length so Almas could handle the twists with ease. Your task is to display the matrix that Almas had at the end of these turns.

## Input format

- The first line consists of one integer n - the size of the matrix.
- In the next n lines, you are given n integers. Numbers can range from 1 to 500.

## Output format

Output the final matrix n x n.
