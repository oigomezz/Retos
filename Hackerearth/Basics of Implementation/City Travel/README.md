# City Travel

You are going from City A to City B. The distance between A and B is S km. In the most days, you can go at most X km one day. But there are N exceptions, in the Tith day, you can go at most Yi km. You need to find out the minimum number of days required to reach city B from city A.

## Input format

- First line contains three integers, S, X, N (1 <= S,X <= 10^9, 0 <= N <= 10^3).
- The (i+1)th line contains two integers Ti, Yi (1 <= Ti, Yi <= 10^9).
- It's guaranteed any two Ti are different. Note that Ti is not sorted.

## Output format

One integer represents the answer.
