# Minimum Transactions

There are n people living in a neighborhood. When in debt, neighbors borrow money from each other to clear their debts. A neighbor has already borrowed money from another neighbor for m times to clear a debt.

All the neighbors want to clear what they owe each other. Their plan is to clear their debts in such a way that the total number of transactions is minimized because the fee per transaction is very high. For example, if the ith person pays the jth person X dollars, then the amount of this particular transaction is X.

You are required to minimize the sum of the transaction amount.
