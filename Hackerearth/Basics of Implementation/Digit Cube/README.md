# Digit Cube

Let n be an integer. We define a function f(n) which returns the cube of sum of digits of n.

You are given two integers n and k. You have to find the value of the integer that is returned when the function is recursively applied k times on n.

Formally, you have to find the value of fk(n).

## Input format

- The first line of each test case consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each of the next T lines consists of two space-separated integers n and k.

## Output format

The output should consist of T lines each containing a single integer corresponding to the required value fk(n).
