# Number of Triangles

You are given a polygon of N sides with vertices numbered from 1,2,...,N. Now, exactly 2 vertices of the polygons are colored black and remaining are colored white. You are required to find the number of triangles denoted by A such that:

1. The triangle is formed by joining only the white-colored vertices of the polygon.
2. The triangle shares at least one side with the polygon.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
- Next T lines contain three space-separated integers N, B1, and B2 where N is the number of sides in the polygon and B1,B2 denote the vertices that are colored black.

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer A representing the number of triangles that can be formed with the given conditions in the problem statement.
