# OR-XOR

Given an array A of size N, you could choose some non-negative number X and change every element of the given array to Ai = Ai + X

Here, + denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

Print the number of total possible values of X for which bitwise OR of every element of the array would be minimum.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.

- The first line of each test case contains integers N, denoting the size of the array A.

- The next line contains N integers.

## Output format

Print the number of total possible values of X for which bitwise OR of every element of the array would be minimum.
