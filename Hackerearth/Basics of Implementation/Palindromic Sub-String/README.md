# Palindromic Sub-String

You are given a string S. You have to check if there exists a sub-string X of string S having length greater than 1 such that the string X and its palindrome both are present as sub-string in the string S.

**Note:** String X and its palindrome string may overlap.

## Input format

First line contains a string S as input.

## Output format

- Print YES if there is a sub-string X as described above and in the next line print the length of maximum sub-string among all that satisfies this condition.
- If there is no sub-string that satisfies the above condition print NO.
