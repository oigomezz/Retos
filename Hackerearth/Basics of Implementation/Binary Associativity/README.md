# Binary Associativity

A binary operation \* on a set S is called associative if it satisfies the associative law:

(x \* y) \* z = x \* (y \* z) for all x,y,z in S.

For the binary set S = {0,1} and a particular binary operator \*, you are given its truth table. Determine if the operation is associative.

## Input format

- First line: A single integer T denoting the number of test cases
- For each test case:
  - First line: Four space-separated integers c0,c1,c2,c3

## Output format

For each test case, print 'Yes' (without quotes) in a new line if the binary operation is associative in nature. Otherwise, print 'No' (without quotes).
