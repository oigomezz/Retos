# A XOR challenge

You are given an integer C such that the XOR of two integers (A,B) is C. In short A ⊕ B = C (⊕ denotes the bitwise the XOR operation).

Out of all possible pairs of A and B, you must find two integers such that their product is maximum.

Let us define L(A) as the length of A in its binary representation. Then, L(A) <= L(C) and L(B) <= L(C).

## Input format

A single integer representing C.

## Output format

Print the maximum product you can achieve under the given conditions.
