# Maximum Utility

You are given an array A containing N integers. The ith integer is Ai and has a utility of Bi. You select a combination of integers whose bitwise OR is less than or equal to K.

You are required to make the sum of utilities of selected integers to be as large as possible.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers denoting array A.
- The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers denoting array B.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum possible sum of utilities of selected integers in a new line.
