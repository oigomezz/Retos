# Special Bit Numbers

A number is known as special bit number if its binary representation contains atleast two consecutive 1's or set bits. For example 7 with binary representation 111 is a special bit number. Similarly 3 (11) is also a special bit number as it contains atleast two consecutive set bits or ones.

Now the problem is, You are given an Array of N integers and Q queries. Each query is defined by two integers L, R. You have to output the count of special bit numbers in the range L to R.

## Input format

- Contains integer N, no of Array elements and Q - Total Number of Queries.
- Next line contains N integers A[i] defining Array elements.
- Next Q lines contains Queries of the type 1 <= L <= R <= N.

## Output format

Output Q lines containing answer for the ith Query.
