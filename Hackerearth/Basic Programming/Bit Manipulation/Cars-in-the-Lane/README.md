If you convert their IDs to a binary number then it means that the bit position where the value is 0, those lanes are closed or else the lanes are open. Now for each highway, you need to count in how many ways the open lanes of the highway can be occupied.

**Note:** If none of the lanes are occupied then also it is counted as a way.

## Input format
