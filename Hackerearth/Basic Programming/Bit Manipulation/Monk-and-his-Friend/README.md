# Monk and his Friend

Monk has a very good friend, Puchi. As weird as his name, are the games he plays.

One fine day, they decided to play a game to test how diverse their choices are. Both of them choose exactly one integer each. Monk chooses an integer M and Puchi chooses an integer P.

The diversity of their choices is defined as the number of bits whose status is different in the binary representation of M and P, i.e., count of bits that are, either set in M and unset in P or set in P and unset in M.

Find the answer to their game.

## Input format

- First line contains T. T test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of 2 space-separated integers P and M.

## Output format

Print the answer to each test case in a new line.
