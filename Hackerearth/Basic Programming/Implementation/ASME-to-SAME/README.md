## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

- The second line of each test case contains N lowercase English characters with some ? (possibly 0) denoting string s.

- The third line of each test case contains N lowercase English characters denoting string t.

## Output format

For each test case, print 'Yes' (without quotation marks) if it is possible to convert s into t. Otherwise, print 'No' (without quotation marks). Print the output in a new line.
