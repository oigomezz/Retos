# Color the Boxes

You are given N boxes that are kept in a straight line. You are also given M colors such that (M <= N). You cannot change the position of boxes. Determine the number of ways to color the boxes such that if you select any M consecutive boxes then the color of each box is unique.

Since the number could be large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Input format

Two space-separated integers N and M.

## Output format

For the provided inputs, print the required answer.
