# Acronym

W.T.H.S.E.C

Confused? Well it stands for Welcome To HackerEarth September Easy Challenge :). It's quite amazing when long words like this get reduced to such a short string. They sound pretty cool and often make the chat interesting. They are almost used everywhere these days.

Our friend Harsh has been recently reducing every sentence he receives to acronym. Since Harsh is a young lad he has his own personal likes and dislikes. There are some words which he just does not want to see in a sentence. So whenever he encounters such a word he simply ignores it. Harsh is thinking of converting a book to an acronym book where each sentence of the book is reduced to its short form. Since Harsh is quite busy in promoting his new book he wants you to help him in doing so.

So he gives you a set of words which he dislikes and a sentence for which he wants to abbreviate. Help him in getting the required abbreviation.

## Input format

The first line contains an integer K which denotes the number of disliked words, This is followed by k lines where each line contains a disliked word, the next line will contain an integer donating the number of words in the given sentence, The last line contains the sentence of which Harsh wants to abbreviate.

The sentence will consist of number of words separated by a space

All words will consist of lowercase English alphabets(a-z)

## Output format

In a single line print the required acronym. The Acronym should be printed in Upper Case English alphabets separated by "." (dots).
