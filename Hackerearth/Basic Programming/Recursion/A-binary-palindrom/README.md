# A binary palindrom

You are given a number N. In one operation, you can either increase the value of N by 1 or decrease the value of N by 1.

Determine the minimum number of operations required (possibly zero) to convert number N to a number P such that binary representation of P is a palindrome.

**Note:** A binary representation is said to be a palindrome if it reads the same from left-right and right-left.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the first line contains an integer N.

## Output format

For each test case in a new line, print the minimum number of operations required.
