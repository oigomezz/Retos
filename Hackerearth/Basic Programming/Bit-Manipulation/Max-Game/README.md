# Max Game

You are given an integer N.

We represent the number N as the sum of distinct numbers that are powers of 2.

**Task** If we put these numbers in an array, your task is to find the maximum element in this array.

Example

Assumption: N = 10

Approach: 10 can be expressed as the sum of [1,2,8] which are powers of 2 and the
maximum of these numbers is 8. Hence, the answer is 8.
