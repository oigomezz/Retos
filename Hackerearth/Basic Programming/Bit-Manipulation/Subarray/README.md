# Subarray

Given a binary array. Find the minimum number of swap operations to be performed such that the Bitwise AND of any subarray of size > 1 is equal. If it can't be done, print -1. Swap can be defined as interchanging array values at any two indices i and j.

## Input format

- The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains N, the number of elements in the array.
- The second line of each test case contains N integers (0 <= a[i] <= 1)

## Output format

Print T lines. Each line should contain the answer for that test case.
