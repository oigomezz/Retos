# Sum as per frequency

There are N numbers A1,A2,...,An, and you are given Q queries. In each query, you are given two integers l and r.

You are required to print the sum of all the numbers whose frequency of occurrence is between l and r (including l and r). Print a single integer for each query in a new line.

## Input format

- The first line contains N denoting the size of the array.
- The second line contains N integers denoting the elements of the array.
- The third line contains Q denoting the number of queries.
- Next Q lines contain l and r.

## Output format

For each query, print the sum of all elements of the array whose frequency of occurrence is between l and r (inclusive) in a new line.
