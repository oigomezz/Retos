# Minimum additions

You are given an array A of N positive integers. Your task is to add a minimum number of non-negative integers to the array such that the floor of an average of array A becomes less than or equal to K.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T that denotes the number of test cases. For each test case:
  - The first line contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the length of the array and the required bound.
  - The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the integer array A.

## Output format

For each test case (in a separate line), print the minimum number of non-negative integers that should be added to array A such that the floor of an average of array A is less than or equal to K.
