# Circular Equation

Given S, find the count of possible values of N which satisfy below condition:

Given N, F(N,i) represent a number which is generated by shifting the digits of N cyclically towards left by i units.

N must satisfy given condition:

- S = Summation { F(N,i) } for all i from 0 to |N| - 1 , where |N| represent number of digits in N.

N can have leading zeroes. As the number of N can be very large output it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.

## Input format

1. First line contain an integer Q, denoting number of queries.
2. Next Q lines contain an integer S.

## Output format

Print a single integer in separate line corresponding to each Query.
