# Monk and Divisor Conundrum

Here is another task for you, prepared by Monk himself. So, this is how it goes :

Given an integer array A of size N, Monk needs you to answer T queries for him. In each query, he gives you 2 integers P and Q. In response to each of these queries, you need to tell Monk the count of numbers in array A. that are either divisible by P, Q, or both.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of array A. The next line contains N space separated integers, where the i-th integer denotes A[i].
- The next line contains a single integer T denoting the number of queries Monk poses to you. Each of the next T lines contains 2 space separated integers P and Q.

## Output format

For each query, print the answer on a new line.
