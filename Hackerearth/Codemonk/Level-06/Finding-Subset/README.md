# Finding Subset

You have a sequence of non-negative numbers and you have to put some of these numbers into a bucket such that:

- The product of any two distinct elements in the bucket is not a cube and the numbers in the bucket should be maximum.

Now you need to tell the maximum number of elements in the bucket.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer n.
- Each of the next n lines contains elements of the sequence.

## Output format

The maximum number of elements in the bucket.
