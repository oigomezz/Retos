# Monk and String Search

Micro has an array A having N strings made of lower case English alphabets. He is interested in finding out the length of the longest string that occurs as a substring among all the strings in A.

Now as you know strings hate Micro, so he asked Monk for help. Since Monk is busy organizing Code Monk, he assigned this task to you.

## Input format

- Each of the following N lines consists of a single string made of lower case English alphabets.

## Output format

Print the length of the longest common substring among all strings in A.
