# Square or Cube

You have an array A consisting of n integers. You will be given q queries.

In each query, you will be given two integers l and r which denotes two positions of the array. P is the product of all the integers between l-th and r-th positions.

For each query you have to determine whether P is a square or cube or both of them or none of them.

## Input format

- First line will contain two integers n and q.
- Next line will contain n integers where i-th (1 <= i <= N) of them represents A[i].
- Each of the next q lines will contain two positive integers l and r.

## Output format

For each query print "Square" if P is only a square number "Cube" if P is only a cubic number "Both" if P is both square and cube otherwise "None".
