# Monk and Conversion Game

Monk was having a great time in the Digital World, and was surprised to see a new game called, "Conversion Game". In this game, two arrays of N integers A1,A2,...,An and B1,B2,...,Bn are playing against each other and Array A wants to convert itself in Array B.

Array A can do two types of operations on itslef:

1. Take two adjacent elements Ai and Ai+1 , increase Ai by 1 and decrease Ai+1 by 1.
2. Take two adjacent elements Ai and Ai+1 , decrease Ai by 1 and increase Ai+1 by 1.

Monk being an awesome coder, wants to know whether Array A can convert itself into Array B, by using any number of such operations. You have to print "YES" (without quotes), if Array A can convert itself into array B, else print "NO" (without quotes).

## Input format

- First line of input will consists of integer T denoting total number of test cases.
- Each test case will begin with integer N.
- Next line will consists of N integers A1,A2,...,An.
- Next line will consists of N integers B1,B2,...,Bn.

## Output format

Print "YES" (without quotes), if Array A can convert itself into array B by using any number of operations, else print "NO" (without quotes).
