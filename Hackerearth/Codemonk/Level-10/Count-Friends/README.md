# Count Friends

There are N students and M relationships of the form u v, which means that student u and student v are friends. If two students are not friends directly but they have a mutual friend, then they too become friends. Your task is to count the number of friends of the i-th student where 1 <= i <= N.

## Input format

- The first line consists of two integers N and M denoting the number of students and the number of relationships respectively.
- The next M lines consists of two integers u and v denoting that student u and student v are friends. u and v can never be equal and relationships are not repeated.

## Output format

Print N space separated integers which tells us the number of friends of the i-th student.
