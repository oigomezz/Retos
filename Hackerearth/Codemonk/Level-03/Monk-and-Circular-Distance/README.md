# Monk and circular distance

Its time for yet another challenge, and this time it has been prepared by none other than Monk himself for Super-Hardworking Programmers like you. So, this is how it goes:

Given N points located on the co-ordinate plane, where the i-th point is located at co-ordinate (xi, yi), you need to answer q queries.

In the i-th query, you shall be given an integer ri, and considering you draw a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with radius ri, you need to report the number of points lying inside or on the circumference of this circle.

For each query, you need to print the answer on a new line.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer N denoting the number of points lying on the co-ordinate plane. Each of the next N lines contains 2 space separated integers xi and yi, denoting the x and y co-ordintaes of the i-th point.
- The next line contains a single integer q, denoting the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains a single integer, where the integer on the i-th line denotes the parameters of the i-th query ri.

## Output format

For each query, print the answer on a new line.
