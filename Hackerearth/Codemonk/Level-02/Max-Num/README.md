Jehta a famous INTER-NIT player at delhi meets a girl and proposes her but she if so fond of mathematics that she doesn't wanna break with her BF as he is a top notch mathematician (We can not disclose). So to have better mathematician as her BF she challenges manish aka jetha and was given an array A of n elements A[1], A[2], A[3],..., A[N].

Let us define a function F(x) = Î£ A[i] & x, here & represents BIT WISE AND operator.

He needs to find the number of different values of x for which F(x) is maximized. But there is a constraint for x that it must have exactly l bits-set in its binary representation.

Your task is to find number of such values for which this function is maximised.

Print the required number. If there are infinite such numbers output -1.

It can be proved that under the given constrainsts the value to be printed is either infinite or not greater than 1e18.

## Input format

- First line will contain number of test cases T.
- Second line of input will contain two space seprated integers n and l (As described in the problem).
- Third and final line of input contains n space seprated integers A[1], A[2], A[3],..., A[N].

## Output format

There will be T lines of output: The only line of output for each test case contains a single integer as described in problem.
