# [Connected Intervals][link]

Given a graph having N vertices and an array A of M undirected edges, find the number of pairs of indices (l,r)
, 1 <= l <= r <= M in A, such that if we consider edges only from A[l], A[l+1], ..., A[r-1], A[r] , then the graph is connected.

## Input format

- First line consists of two space separated integers denoting N and M.
- Following M lines consists of two space separated u and v, denoting an undirected edge.

## Output format

Print the required answer.
