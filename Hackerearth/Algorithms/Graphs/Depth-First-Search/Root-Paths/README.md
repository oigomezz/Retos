# [Root paths][link]

Alice and Bob play a game. The game starts with a graph that contains n nodes and no edges. You are required to process q queries of two types:

- Add a directed edge from u[i] to v[i].
- Print x[i] if there is a directed path from vertex 1 to vertex x[i]. Otherwise, print 0.

## Input format

- The first line contains n, q, and t denoting the number of nodes, the number of queries, and a constant number t.
- Next q lines contain the queries, each with one of the following formats:
  1. Queries of the first type: 1 a b.
  2. Queries of the second type: 2 a.

## Output format

For each query of type 2, print one integer denoting the answer to the query.
