# [Maximum Spanning Tree][link]

You are given a weighted graph with N vertices and M edges. Find the total weight of its maximum spanning tree.

## Input format

- The first line contains one integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case starts with a line containing 2 space-separated integer: N and M.
- Each of the following M lines contain description of one edge: three different space-separated integers: a, b and c. a and b are different and from 1 to N each and denote numbers of vertices that are connected by this edge. c denotes weight of this edge.

## Output format

For each test case output one integer - the total weight of its maximum spanning tree.
