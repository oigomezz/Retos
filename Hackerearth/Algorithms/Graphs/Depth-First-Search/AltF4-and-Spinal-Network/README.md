# [AltF4 and Spinal Network][link]

AltF4 is into his networking class and his teacher introduces him to bus topology. Being bored of the class, he his lost into his own thoughts where he discovers a new topology of his own - the Spinal Network. In this topology, we have a central line just like the bus topology. All the nodes (or hops, or computers) are either in the central line itself, or it is directly connected to the central line. To make things easier he says that the topology given should be a tree. Resembles the spinal cord, isn't it? Given a tree, you need to figure out if it is spinal or not.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T.
- T test cases follow. Each test case starts with an integer N the number of nodes in the tree.
- N - 1 lines follow each containing two integers U V, the nodes which have an edge between them.

## Output format

For each test case, output "YES" if the tree given is Spinal else output "NO". Quotes are for clarity only and should not be printed.
