# [Feasible relations][link]

As a programmer, you sometimes have to deal with some math and this is the time to do it. You are given a list of binary relations, equalities and inequalities, like a = b, a != d, b = c etc. Your task is to output YES if you can assign integers to input variables in such a way, that you can satisfy all equalities and inequalities. Otherwise you should output NO.

## Input format

- In the first line there is one integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case have two integers N and K given in the first line denoting the number of variables and the number of relations between them for this test case.
- K lines follow. Each of them is of the form "x1 R x2" where x1 and x2 are integers representing variables and R is either "=" or "!=" and denotes the kind of relation between these variables.

## Output format

Output exactly T lines. In i-th of them, output the answer to the i-th test case.
