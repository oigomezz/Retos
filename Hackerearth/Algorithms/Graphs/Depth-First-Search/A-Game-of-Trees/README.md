# [A game of trees][link]

You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. Here, A and B are playing with the tree. In each turn (starting with A), each player can select a vertex v that contains no parent and delete a path with at least two vertices starting from v.

A player loses if he or she cannot make the turn in the game. For each test case, determine who will win.

## Input format

- The first line contains t denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains n denoting the number of tree's vertices.
- Next n-1 lines of each test case contain pi that means the (i+1)th vertex's parent is pi.

## Output format

For each test case, print A if A wins, otherwise print B.
