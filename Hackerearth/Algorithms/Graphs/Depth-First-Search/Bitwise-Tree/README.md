# [Bitwise Tree][link]

You are given a tree consisting of N nodes, where the i-th node has a value Ai assigned to it.

You can do the following operation any number of times. In an operation, you can :

- Select a node i (1 <= i <= N) and set Ai = Ai / 2.

Find the minimum number of operations to be performed so that the bitwise AND of the values present in any two adjacent nodes of the tree is zero.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer N denoti,Yi.It is guaranteed that the nodes and edges form a tree.

## Output format

For each query, print the minimum number of operations to be performed so that the bitwise AND of the values present in any two adjacent nodes of the tree is zero.
