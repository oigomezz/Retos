# [Tree And Special node][link]

Given a rooted undirected tree T consisting of N nodes with 1 as the root of the tree. Each node of the tree has a value associated with it, where the value of the i-th node is A[i]. A node x is said to be special if the path from the root to node x contains all distinct values. Your task is to find the number of special nodes.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
- Next line contains N space separated integers where the ith integer denotes A[i].
- Next N-1 lines consist of two space-separated integers u and v, denoting that there is an edge between node u to node v.

## Output format

Print a single integer, denoting the number of special nodes in the tree.
