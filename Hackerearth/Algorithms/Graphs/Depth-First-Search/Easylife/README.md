Given an undirected graph. Density of a graph is |E|/|V|. Your task is to choose non-empty set of vertices V such that subgraph induced on V has maximal density and print this density. But if maximal density is strictly greater than 1, just print ">1".

## Input format

- The first line of input contains two integers n and m - number of edges and vertices in the graph, respectively.
- Then m lines with edge descriptions follows. Each line contains two integers u, v - vertices incident to this edge.

## Output format

If maximal density of a subgraph is not bigger than 1, then print it as irreducible fraction. Otherwise, print ">1" (without quotes).
