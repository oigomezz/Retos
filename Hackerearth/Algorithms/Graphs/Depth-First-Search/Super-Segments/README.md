# [Segments maybe Super segments][link]

You have an array A of integers between 0 and 10‚Å∂. Initially, you do not know exactly the value of any element of the array, but you know that the length of the array is n. Also, you are given m segments of the array l r x, where l is the left bound of the segment, r is the right bound of the segment, x is the sum of the segment. Then You are given q queries ql qr. For every query, you need to print the sum of elements of the array A on interval [ql, qr], if it is impossible to print -1.

## Input format

- First line will contain T, number of testcases.
- In first line of testcase you are given n m q.
- In next m lines of testcase you are given information about array l, r, x.
- In next q lines of testcase you are given queries in form ql, qr.

## Output format

For each query, you need to print the answer in a single line.
