# [Finding pairs][link]

You are given a rooted tree with N nodes and node 1 as a root. There is a unique path between any two nodes. Here, d(i,j) is defined as a number of edges in a unique path between nodes i and j.

You have to find the number of pairs (i,j) such that and d(i,j) = d(i,1) - d(j,1).

## Input format

- The first line contains n denoting the integer.
- Next n-1 lines denote the edges of the tree.

## Output format

Print a single integer denoting the number of pairs (i,j) such that and d(i,j) = d(i,1) - d(j,1).
