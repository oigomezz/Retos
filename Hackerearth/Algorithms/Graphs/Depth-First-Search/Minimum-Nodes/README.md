# [Minimum Nodes][link]

You are given a tree with N nodes and each node has some value assigned to it. Now you are given Q tasks of the form X K.

For each task, you have to find the path starting from X such that sum of nodes in the path is at least K and it contains minimum number of nodes. If such path exists, print the count of nodes in the path, else print -1.

## Input format

- First line: Two space-separated integers N and Q.
- Second line: N space-separated integers (denoting vali).
- Next N -1 lines: Two space-separated integers U and V (denoting an edge between the nodes U and V).
- Next Q lines:Two space-separated integers X and K.

## Output format

For each task, print the required answer in a new line.
