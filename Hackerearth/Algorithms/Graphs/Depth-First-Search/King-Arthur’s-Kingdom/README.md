# [King Arthurâ€™s Kingdom][link]

You are given a tree consisting of N nodes and another integer K, where the node has value equal to v[i].

Now, we call the value of a sub-tree the number of distinct v[i] among all nodes it contains. You need to find the number of sub-trees of this tree having value <=K.

A sub-tree of a tree is a subset of nodes and edges of the tree that form a single connected component.

## Input format

- Input starts with an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each case starts with two positive integers N and K.
- The next line consists of N space separated integers, where the i-th integer denotes v[i].
- Each of the next N-1 lines contains 2 space separated integers u and v, denoting an edge between nodes u and v.

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer on a new line.
