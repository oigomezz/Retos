# [Prime Path][link]

Given a tree with N nodes numbered 1 to N and N-1 edges, rooted at node 1. Find the number of unordered pair of distinct vertices (i,j) such that there exists exactly one prime number on the simple path between vertex i and j.

## Note

- We only need to consider unordered pairs i.e. (i,j) and (j,i) are counted once.
- The values of nodes in the path will be the node numbers.

## Input format

- The first line contains N denoting the number of vertices in the tree.
- The next N-1 lines contain two space-separated integers u,v denoting an edge between vertex u and v.

## Output format

Print a single integer, denoting the number of such pairs (i,j).
