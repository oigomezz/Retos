# [Restoring trees][link]

You are given the start and finish times of a DFS (Depth-first search) traversal of the vertices that are available in a rooted tree. Your task is to restore the tree.

## Input format

- First line: Contains an integer n that represents the number of vertices of the tree.
- Second line: Contains n space-separated integers that denote the start times of the vertices available in a tree.
- Third line: Contains n space-separated integers that denote the finish times of the vertices available in a tree.

## Output format

Print n integers. The i-th integer denotes the parent of the i-th vertex or 0 if it is the root of the tree.

**Note:** The vertices of the tree are numbered from 1 to n.
