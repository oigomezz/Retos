# [Edge Destruction][link]

Given a graph having N vertices and M bidirectional edges, with each edge having some length and some destruction cost. You have to increase the length of the shortest path between vertex 1 and vertex N, for that you can destroy some edges. Find the minimum cost of doing it.

## Input format

- First line consists of two space separated integers denoting N and M.
- Following M lines consists of four space separated integers X Y D C denoting that there is an edge between vertex X and Y having length D and destruction cost C.

## Output format

Print the required answer.
