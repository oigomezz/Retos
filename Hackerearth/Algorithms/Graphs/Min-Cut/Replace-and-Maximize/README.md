# [Replace and maximize][link]

You are given a square grid consisting of H rows and columns respectively. Each of the cells in the grid consists of either 0, 1, or 2. You are required to make the grid binary which means that the cell value should be 1 or 2. To do this task, you must replace each 2 and you can replace any 2 by either 0 or 1.

Grid value: It is the sum of XOR between all pairs of cells such that they share the side.

Your task is to replace each 2 by 1 or 0 in such a way that the grid value is maximized.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer H denoting the number of rows and columns in the grid.
- Next H lines contain H space-separated integers representing grid which are either 0, 1, or 2.

## Output format

Print a single integer denoting the maximum grid value.
