# [Wise Business][link]

You just graduated from the business school of MagicLand and are about to start your own business. You will be buying some magical potions from the great wizard of MagicLand and selling them at your hometown HackerLand.

The great wizard sells N different types of potions where the i-th (1 <= i <= N) potion is of the price Ai. You can convert a potion of type Xi to a potion of type Yi (1 <= i <= M).

The conversion of potion from one type to another is unidirectional.

What is the maximum amount of profit you can make from buying and selling a single potion?

## Input format

- The first line contains T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case has two space-separated integers, N & M, representing the number of different types of potions and the number of different kinds of conversions you can make, respectively.
- The following line contains N space-separated integers representing the array A, where Ai is the price of a potion of the i-th type.
- The i-th of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers, Xi & Yi, denoting that you can convert a potion of type Xi to a potion of type Yi.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single integer representing the maximum possible profit.
