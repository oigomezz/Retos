# [Vertices and edges][link]

You are given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges.

Consider all shortest paths between vertices 1 and n, for any vertex such as v (1 <= v <= n), say that, if v is in either all shortest paths or some of them or none of them.

## Input format

- The first line contains two integers n,m denoting the number of the graph's vertices and edges respectively.
- Each of the following m lines contains space-separated vi,ui and wi describing the graph's i-th edge's vertices (vi,ui) and its weight (wi).

## Output format

Print n lines where the i-th line contains either all if vertex i is in all shortest paths between 1 to n or some if vertex i is in some of shortest paths or none otherwise.
