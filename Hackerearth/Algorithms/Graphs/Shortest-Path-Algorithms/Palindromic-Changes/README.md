# [Palindromic changes][link]

You are given the cost of changing M pairs of lowercase characters x to y. You are also given a string S.

You can change a character in string S to another lowercase character by spending the cost you were given earlier. Determine the minimum cost that is required to make S a palindrome.

You can assume that it is always possible to make S a palindrome.

## Input format

- The first line contains string S.
- The next line contains integer M.
- The next M lines each contain a pair of lowercase characters x, y, and cost c. You can change character x to character y or vise versa spending cost c.

## Output format

Print the minimum cost that is required to make S a palindrome.
