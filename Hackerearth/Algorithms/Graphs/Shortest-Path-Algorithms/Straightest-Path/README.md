# [Straightest path][link]

You are playing a game on a grid of size n \* m. The game has the following rules:

- The grid contains cells that the player can move to. These are denoted by a period (.)
- The grid contains cells that the player cannot move to. These are denoted by an asterisk (\*)
- The player starts on the cell marked with a V.
- The player has to reach the cell marked with an H.

Write a program to find the path which has the minimum number of changes in direction. Print the number of times that the player needs to turn on the path

## Input format

- First line: N and M
- Next N lines: M characters (denoting the cells of the grid)

## Output format

Print the minimum number of times that the player needs to turn on the required path. If no path exists, print -1.
