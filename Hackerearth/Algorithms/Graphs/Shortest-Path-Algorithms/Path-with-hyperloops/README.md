# [Path with hyperloops][link]

You live in year 2050 where hyperloop has been invented. Currently you are in city X and you want to reach city Y using minimum amount of money. From city u to v if you use hyperloop than it costs 2 dollars otherwise it costs 1 dollar.

Print the minimum cost to reach the end city from the starting city.

## Input format

- You are given N, M, K, start, end - the number of cities, number of roads and number of hyperloops, starting and ending city.
- Next M line contains 2 values u and v meaning there is a bidirectional path between u and v.
- Next K lines contains 2 values u and v meaning there is a bidirectional hyperloop between city u and v.

## Output format

If it is impossible to reach the end city then print -1. Otherwise print the minimum cost to reach the end city from the starting city
