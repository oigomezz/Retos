# [Fredo and his Birthday Gift][link]

It was Fredo's birthday yesterday. He got a simple graph of N vertices and M edges as one of the birthday gifts. He has been bragging about his gift to all his friends. One of his friends asked him to do the following task on the graph:

For each of the vertices in the graph, find the maximum length simple path ending at that vertex. Being unable to solve it himself, he asks you for help. Help Fredo!

**Note:** Length of a simple path = number of edges in the path.

A simple path is a path in a graph which does not have repeating vertices.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting N and M.
- The following M lines consist of two space separated integers X and Y denoting there is an edge between vertices X and Y.

## Output format

For each test case, print for each vertex(starting from vertex 1) , length of the maximum length simple path ending at that vertex.
