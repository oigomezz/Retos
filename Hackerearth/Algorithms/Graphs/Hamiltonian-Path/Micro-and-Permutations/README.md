# [Micro and Permutations][link]

Micro is having a graph having N vertices numbered from 1 to N and M edges. All the edges are bidirectional. Micro wants to find out the number of lucky permutations in the graph.

A permutation of the vertices (v1,v2,v3,...,vn) is called lucky permutation, if for every vertex vi, where 1 <= i <= N-1, there is an edge between vi and vi+1. Help Micro find out the number of lucky permutations in the graph.

## Input format

- First line consists of two space separated integers denoting N and M.
- M lines follow each consisting of two space separated integers X and Y denoting there is an edge between vertices numbered X and Y.

## Output format

Print the number of lucky permutations in the graph.
