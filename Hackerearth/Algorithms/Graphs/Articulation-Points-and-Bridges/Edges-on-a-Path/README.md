# [Edges on a path][link]

Given a connected graph with n nodes and m edges, where m <= n.You are also given two nodes a and b of the graph.

You need to find the number of edges which are present in all paths between a and b.

## Input format

- The First line contains two space separated integers N and M, the number of nodes and edges respectively.
- The second line contains two space separated integers a and b.
- Then m lines follow, the i-th line contains two integers xi and yi (1≤xi,yi≤n, xi≠yi) --- the endpoints of the i-th edge.

## Output format

The output should contain a single number which is the number of edges present in all paths between a and b.
