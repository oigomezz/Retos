# [Two papers II][link]

M found two papers and a pencil in his room (as you know it's so valuable for a prisoner). a weighted (weights are either 0 or 1) graph is drawn on the first paper.

M is forced to draw a spanning tree of the graph (which is drawn on the first paper) on the second paper which includes odd number of 1 weighted edges.

Can M draw a spanning tree with the conditions described above?

## Input format

- First line contains two integers n,m, number of first paper graph's vertices and number of first paper graph's edges.
- Each of the following m lines contains vi,ui and wi separated space describing graph's i-th edge's vertices(vi,ui) and its weight (wi).

## Output format

In the only line of output print YES if M can draw a spanning tree of the first paper's graph with odd number of 1 weighted edges and otherwise print NO.
