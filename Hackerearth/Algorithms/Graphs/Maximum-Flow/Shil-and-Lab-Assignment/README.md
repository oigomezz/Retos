For the lab assignment of this week, Shil got N numbers A1 , A2, ... AN. He must assign each of these numbers a unique integer value from 1 to M. Let Ci be the integer assigned to Ai. Shil must assign numbers in such a way that maximum number of Ai are divisible by their Ci. You must print maximum numbers of Ai that could be made divisible by Ci in optimal assignment.

## Input format

- First Line of input consists of integer N and M.
- Next N lines consists of N integers with ith line containing integer Ai.
