# [Connected Components][link]

You are given an undirected simple graph G containing exactly n distinct nodes.

The nodes are numbered from 1 to n.

Suppose that (u,v) is an edge of G if and only if u \* v is a perfect square.

Please compute the number of the connected components of G.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists one positive integer n, the number of distinct nodes.

## Output format

PFor each testcase, output the number of the connected components of G.
