A river has N checkpoints on left side and M checkpoints on the right side. P bridges are built connecting checkpoints across the river. Guards needs to be placed on checkpoints, a guard can protect all the bridges on which this checkpoint is present. There can be more than one guard to protect a single bridge.

Find the minimum number of guards required to protect all the bridges over the river.

## Input format

- First line contains three space-separated integers N M P.
- Next P lines contains two space separated integers u v, denoting a bridge connecting the u checkpoint on the left side to the v checkpoint on the right side.

## Output format

Print the minimum number of guards required to protect all the bridges over the river.
