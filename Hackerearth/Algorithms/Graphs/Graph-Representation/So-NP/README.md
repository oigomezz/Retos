# [So NP][link]

Once a upon time a problem setter offered a problem to Arpa. Like always Arpa said "eaaasy", but after a time Arpa said this problem is so NP.

Solve this problem to prove Arpa is always right and his first opinion is correct.

You are given a graph with n nodes and m edges. Calculate maximum number of edges that can be removed from the graph so that it contains exactly k connected components.

## Input format

- The first line contains n, m, k (in order).
- The next m lines have 2 number, ui and vi that showS there is an edge between those nodes.

## Output format

Maximum number of edges that can be removed from the graph such that it contains exactly k connected components.

If the graph intially has more than k components print -1.
