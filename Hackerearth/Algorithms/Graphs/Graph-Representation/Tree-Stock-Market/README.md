# [Tree-Stock Market][link]

Mr X is very curious to know about the frequency of stocks. But unfortunately for him, the stocks are represented as nodes of a tree with prices of the stocks as their value. Mr X hates trees as much as he loves to learn about stocks. So he asks for your help:

Given a tree with N nodes (each node represents a stock) numbered from 1 to N (rooted at 1). Each stock has a price/value which is denoted by Pi. He is very curious so he asks a lot of questions of the form: U L R . For each of his question he wants to know how many different stock prices/values are present in the subtree of U for which frequency is between L and R (Both inclusive).

## Input format

- The first line contains 2 space seperated integers N and Q, the number of nodes in the tree and the number of queries.
- Following N-1 lines contains 2 integers a and b denoting an edge between a and b.
- Next line contains N space seperated integers denoting the value of each node.
- Following Q lines contains 3 space seperated integers U,L,R.

## Output format

Output Q lines containing the answer of each query.
