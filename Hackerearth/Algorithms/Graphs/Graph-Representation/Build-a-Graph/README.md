# [Build a graph][link]

You are given an integer n. Determine if there is an unconnected graph with n vertices that contains at least two connected components and contains the number of edges that is equal to the number of vertices. Each vertex must follow one of these conditions:

1. Its degree is less than or equal to 1.
2. It's a cut-vertex.

## Input format

- First line: n

## Output format

Print Yes if it is an unconnected graph. Otherwise, print No.
