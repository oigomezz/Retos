# [Weighted Tree Function][link]

You are given a weighted tree with N nodes and N-1 edges.

E is defined as ΣΣ F(i,j). Also, F(i,j) is equal to = (Maximum value of the edge that is present on the simple path between node i and j) x i x j.

You are required to determine the value of E modulo 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in a tree.
- The next N - 1 lines contain three space-separated integers u,v,w denoting an edge between node u and v with weight w.

## Output format

Print the required value of E modulo 10⁹ + 7.
