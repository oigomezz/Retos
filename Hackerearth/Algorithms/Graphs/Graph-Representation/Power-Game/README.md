# [Power Game][link]

Sam and Andrea are playing a game today. On a paper, there is a connected graph drawn with N vertices and M edges. Every edge has a power assigned to it denoted by an array Ai.

In every turn, Sam & Andrea have to perform the following one by one:

- Pick an edge which if removed will increase the number of connected components in graph.
- Add the power of the edge picked above to the score.

If everyone played optimally, find the maximum & minimum score Sam can have if he start's the game first or second.

## Input format

- First line contains two space-separated integers N and M.
- Next line contains M space separated integers denoting the array A.
- Next M lines containts two space-separated integers denoting an edge.

## Output format

Print two space-separated integers denoting the maximum & minimum score Sam can have in the game.
