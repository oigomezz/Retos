# [Tree Path][link]

Given an undirected tree with N nodes. Every node has a weight assigned to it denoted by array W.

Among all the simple paths of length K in the given tree, Sam can choose to pick any path and traverse on it.

Help Sam choose a path such that the maximum weight node present on the path is as minimum as possible.

Return -1, if no such path exists.

## Input format

- First line contains two space-separated integers N K.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the array W.
- Next N - 1 lines contains two space separated integers u v, denoting an edge between node u and v.

## Output format

Print an integer denoting the maximum weight node present on the path traversed by Sam.
