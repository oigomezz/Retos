You are given a string that contains only three characters a, b, and c. You can change at the most k characters in the string. The uniformity index of a string is defined by the maximum length of the substring that contains the same character. Your task is to determine the maximum uniformity index than can be achieved.

## Input format

- First line: Two integers n and k where n denotes the size of the string and k as specified in the question.
- Second line: A string of length n.

## Output format

Print a single integer denoting the maximum uniformity that can be achieved.
