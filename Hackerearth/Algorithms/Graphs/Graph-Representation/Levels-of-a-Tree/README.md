# [Levels of a tree][link]

You are given a tree that consists of n vertex. In this tree, vertex 1 is the root vertex. Here, leveli is defined as a set of vertex where the distance of the vertexes from the root vertex is equal to i.

You are required to remove at most k levels of the tree in such a manner that after removing the vertexes, the maximum size of the recently-created components is minimum.

## Input format

- First line: Two integers n, k denoting the number of nodes in the tree and maximum number of removed levels.
- Next line: n-1 space-separated integers where the i-th integers is pari and it denotes the parent of vertex i.

## Output format

Print the required number.
