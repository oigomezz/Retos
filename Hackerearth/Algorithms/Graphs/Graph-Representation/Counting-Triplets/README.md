# [Counting triplets][link]

You are given an undirected, complete graph G that contains N vertices. Each edge is colored in either white or black. You are required to determine the number of triplets (i,j,k) (1 <= i < j < k <= N) of vertices such that the edges (i,j), (j,k), (i,k) are of the same color.

There are M white edges and (N(N - 1)/2) - M black edges.

## Input format

- First line: Two integers N and M.
- (i+1)th line: Two integers ui and vi denoting that the edge (ui, vi) is white in color.

## Output format

Print an integer that denotes the number of triples that satisfy the mentioned condition.
