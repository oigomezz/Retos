# [Example][link]

You are given an array A that contains N integer elements. The value Ai of every element is such that the number of divisors of Ai is at most 7.

Find the length of the smallest non-empty subsequence of this array such that the product of elements in the subsequence is a perfect square. If no such subsequence exists, then print -1.

A sequence A is a subsequence of an array B if A can be obtained from by B deleting several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting array A.

## Output format

Print an integer, denoting the length of the smallest non-empty subsequence of the array that satisfies the mentioned conditions.
