# [Minimum cost][link]

You are standing at position 1. From position i, you can walk to i+1 or i-1 with cost 1. From position i, you can travel to without any cost to pi(p is a permutation of numbers 1,...,n). You have to reach position n. Determine the minimum possible cost.

## Input format

- First line: T denotes the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - First line: n.
  - Second line: n integers where the i-th integer is pi.

**Note:** It is guaranteed that p is a permutation.

## Output format

PPrint the minimum possible cost.
