# [Permutation][link]

Given a permutation of 1 to n, you need to perform some operations to make it into increasing order. Each operation is to reverse an interval a1, a2, ..., ax (1 <= x <= n) (a prefix). Your goal is to minimize the number of operations.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer n.
- The second line contains n space separated integers, representing the sequence a.

## Output format

An integer representing the answer, that is, the minimum number of operations needed to make the permutation into increasing order.
