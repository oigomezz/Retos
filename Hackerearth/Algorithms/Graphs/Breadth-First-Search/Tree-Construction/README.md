# [Tree construction][link]

You are given a tree consisting of n nodes.

You can select any number of nodes from the tree that you want to save. The remaining nodes will be destroyed but the saved nodes again form a tree.

Find the total number of such ways to form the tree.

Note: You may not select any node or you may save all nodes.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer N ( 2 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵) denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
- Next N-1 lines contain two integers,u and v, denoting an edge from node u to node v.

## Output format

Print the required number of ways modulo 10⁹ + 7.
