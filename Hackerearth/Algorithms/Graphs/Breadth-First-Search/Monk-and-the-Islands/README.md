# [Monk and the Islands][link]

Monk visits the land of Islands. There are a total of N islands numbered from 1 to N. Some pairs of islands are connected to each other by Bidirectional bridges running over water.
Monk hates to cross these bridges as they require a lot of efforts. He is standing at Island #1 and wants to reach the Island #N. Find the minimum the number of bridges that he shall have to cross, if he takes the optimal route.

## Input format

- First line contains T. T testcases follow.
- First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, M.
- Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers X and Y , denoting that there is a bridge between Island X and Island Y.

## Output format

Print the answer to each test case in a new line.
