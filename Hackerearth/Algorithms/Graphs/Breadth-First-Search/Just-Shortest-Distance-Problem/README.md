# [Just shortest distance problem][link]

You are given an empty graph of N vertices and M queries of two types:

1. Given a number X answer what is the shortest distance from the vertex 1 to the vertex X.
2. Given two integers X, Y add the new oriented edge from X to Y.

## Input format

- The first line contains two integers N and M. The following M lines describe queries in the format mentioned above.

## Output format

For each query of the first type output one integer on a separate line - answer for the corresponding query. Output -1 if it's impossible to get to the vertex in this query from the vertex 1.
