# [Add - Subtract][link]

Chandan is back with his array to blow your mind. As usual Chandan has an array consisting of N integers .He allows you to perform 2 kinds of operation on his array.

1. Type 1 : Increment any integer of the array by 1.
2. Type 2 : Decrement any integer of the array by 1.

You can perform these operation as many times as you want on his array.

Each operation of Type 1 costs 3 while each operation of Type 2 costs 5.

Now Chandan wants to have K equal elements in his array.So he asks you to tell him the minimum cost required in obtaining K equal elements in his array.

## Input format

- The first line contains T indicating test cases.
- Second line contains 2 integers N indicating the number of elements in his array and K.
- Third line contains N space separated integers denoting Chandan array.

## Output format

The minimum cost required to get K equal elements.
