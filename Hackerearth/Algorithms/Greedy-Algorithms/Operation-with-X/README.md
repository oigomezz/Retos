# [Operation with X][link]

We have an array Arr of N integer points and an integer X. At each element Arr[i], we will either add X or subtract X. We have to operate in such a way, that the absolute difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the array is minimal.

Find the minimum absolute difference between the maximum value obtained by the operation.

## Input format

- The first line contains two space-separated integers N and X, where N denotes the size of the array Arr.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting array Arr.

## Output format

Print the minimum value obtained by the operation.
