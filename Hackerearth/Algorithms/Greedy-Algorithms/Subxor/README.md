# [Subxor][link]

You are provided an array A of n integers. You are required to partition the array into the minimum number of subarrays such that the XOR of any non-empty subset of the subarrays is not equal to zero. If no such partition exists, then print -1. Otherwise, print 1.

## Note

- A subarray is a non-empty contiguous subsequence of an array.
- The XOR of a set of subarrays is defined as the sum of determined XOR's of the numbers in all the subarrays when accumulated.

## Input format

- The first line consists of an integer n that is followed by n space-separated integers.

## Output format

Print the answer in a single line.
