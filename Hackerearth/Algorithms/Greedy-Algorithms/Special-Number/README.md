# [Special Number][link]

We are given an array nums of positive integers.

A special number is a number that is not divisible by the square of any number (>1).

You have to find the number of the non-empty different subsets of the array such that the product of elements in it is a special number. Return answer modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer N, where N is denoting the size of the array.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting array nums.

## Output format

Print the number of the non-empty different subsets.
