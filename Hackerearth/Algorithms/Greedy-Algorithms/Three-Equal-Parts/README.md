# [Three Equal parts][link]

You will be given a binary array A of length N. (Array filled with 0s and/or 1s)

You need to divide the array in three parts (that is , three subarrays) in such a way that all these parts represent same value in decimal.

If it is possible to divide the array, output the common decimal value modulo 1000000007 else output -1.

See Sample test-case for better understanding.

**Note:** Here binary to decimal conversion is done using standard conversion method, i.e., right to left( Example - 1010 is 10 not 5).

## Input format

- First line represents the number of test-cases T.
- For each case:
  - First line represent the number N, size of the array.
  - Next line consists of N numbers either 0 or 1.

## Output format

For each case, output the required answer in new line.
