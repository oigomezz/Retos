# [Bob and the minimum string][link]

Bob has been provided a string S of size N containing lowercase characters. He took two empty strings, U and V, and performed the following operations:

1. Extract the first character from string S and append it at the end of string U.
2. Extract the last character from string U and append it at the end of string V.

Bob can perform the above operations any number of times. After some operations, he wants to get the string S and U empty, and string V should be lexicographically minimum.

Your task is to help Bob find the lexicographically minimum possible string V that can be formed.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the first line will contain integer N, the size of the input string S, and the second line will contain the string S itself.

## Output format

For each test case, print the lexicographically minimum possible string V that can be formed.
