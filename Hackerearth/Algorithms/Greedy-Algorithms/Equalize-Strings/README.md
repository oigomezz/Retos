# [Equalize strings][link]

You are given two binary strings A and B and are required to make A equals to B. There are two types of operations:

1. Swap any two adjacent bits or characters in string A. The cost of this operation is 1 unit.
2. Flip the bit or character of the string. The cost of this operation is 1 unit.

What is the minimum cost to make string A equal to B?

## Input format

- The first line contains one integer that denotes the length of both strings.
- The next two lines take two strings A and B of length n as an input.

## Output format

Print one integer that represents the minimum cost required to convert string A to string B.
