# [Array's force][link]

Let's consider some array A. The following algorithm calculates it's force:

1. Find all the continuous blocks where all the elemens of A are equal.
2. Calculate sum of squared lengths of these blocks.

We can reorder some elements and get array with greater force. In the example above we can move the first element of A to the end and get array A = {3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 2} with force 2² + 3² + 1² + 3² = 23.

You are given an array. What is the maximum force you can get by reordering some of its elements?

## Input format

- The first line contains integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The following T lines contain 4 integers each: A[0], A[1], N, MOD.
- Array A of N elements is generated by the following way:
  - A[0], A[1] are given
  - A[i] = (A[i - 1] + A[i - 2]) modulo MOD for 1 < i < N.

## Output format

For each test case output one integer on the separate line - answer for the question.
