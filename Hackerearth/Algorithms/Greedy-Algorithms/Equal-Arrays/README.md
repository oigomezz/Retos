# [Equal Arrays][link]

You are given two arrays A and B of length N and M respectively. You can perform the following operation any number of times on A and B.

- Replace any subarray of the array with the sum of the elements in the subarray.

You want to make A and B equal. Find the maximum possible length of arrays A and B such that A is equal to B. If it is impossible to make A and B equal then print -1.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M, denoting the length of the array A and B.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, elements of array A.
- The third line of each test case contains M space-separated integers, elements of array B.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum possible length of arrays A and B such that A is equal to B. If it is impossible to make A and B equal then print -1 in a new line.
