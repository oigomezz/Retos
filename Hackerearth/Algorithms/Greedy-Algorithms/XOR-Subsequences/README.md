# [XOR subsequences][link]

You are given an array A consisting of N integers. Your task is to find the longest subsequence S, such that XOR of any two elements in S is non-zero.

You are required to print the size of S(L) and the array of indices that are chosen for S. In case of multiple such arrays, choose the lexicographically smallest array.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in array A.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers of array A.

## Output format

For each test case:

- The first line must contain the maximum size (L) of S that can be chosen as a subsequence.
- The second line must contain space-separated integers denoting the lexicographically minimal array of indices that can be chosen.
