# [Protect the Cities][link]

There are N cities in Imaginary Land. The President of Imaginary Land uses the Cartesian coordinates. Each city is located at some point with integer co-ordinates. The President is very careful and concerned about the well-being of the citizens of his country.

For that reason, he wants to create a boundary and cover all the cities inside that boundary. The boundary should in the shape of a square and should be parallel to the coordinate axes. Find the minimum area enclosed by the boundary such that all the cities are on or inside the boundary.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single positive integer N denoting the number of cities in Imaginary Land.
- Each of the next N lines contains two integers xi and yi denoting the coordinates of the i-th city.

## Output format

For each test-case, output a single non-negative integer denoting the minimum area of the square boundary that encloses all the cities inside or on its boundary.
