# [Three rectangles][link]

You are given a rectangle of height H and width W. You must divide this rectangle exactly into three pieces such that each piece is a rectangle of integral height and width. You are required to minimize AreaMax - AreaMin where AreaMax is the area of the largest rectangle and AreaMin is the area of the smallest rectangle, among all three rectangle pieces.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers H and W denoting the height and width of the rectangle.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum possible value of AreaMax - AreaMin in a new line.
