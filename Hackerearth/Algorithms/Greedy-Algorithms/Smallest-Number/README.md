# [Smallest number][link]

You are given a string S that represents a number. This string consists of the following characters only:

- 1
- 2
- 3

You can perform the following operation:

- Swap any two adjacent characters only if the absolute difference between the characters is 1

Your task is to determine the smallest number that can be formed by using the provided operation. You can perform this operation any number of times (possibly zero).

**Note:** Assume 1 based indexing.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T that denotes the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer that denotes the length of string S.
  - The second line contains a string that denotes the string S.

## Output format

For each test case, print a string representing the smallest number that can be formed in a new line.
