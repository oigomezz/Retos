# [A dice tower][link]

Bob is a big fan of cubical dices. He builds a dice tower by stacking the dice one on top of the other.

Lee was given an integer N. He set out to build a tower with a minimum height, with the sum of points on all of its outer surfaces equaling the provided number N (outer surface: the side surface, the top, and bottom faces).

You had to assist Lee in calculating the minimum number of dice needed to build the tower.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.

## Output format

For each test case, print the only integer that denotes the number of dices in the required tower in a new line. If no such tower exists, print -1.
