# [An Easy Problem][link]

Mr X loves his clock. His clock displays time in the HH:MM. Format using the 24 hour system, the first 2 characters in the string are used to display the current hour, with possible leading zeros. Also, the last 2 characters are used to display the current minutes, also with possible leading zeroes.

Now, Mr X came up with a new thing, where he calls a particular time displayed by the clock good if the sum of all digits written on the clock during that time is divisible by a given number x.

You have been given the current time displayed by the clock and an integer x. You need to find the minimum number of minutes Mr X needs to wait, to see a good time being displayed by the clock. If the clock is already displaying a good time, Mr X does not need to wait at all.

If the clock will never ever display a good time, then print -1 instead as the answer.

## Input format

- The first line contains a string in the HH:MM format. The next line contains a single integer x.

## Output format

Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of minutes Mr X needs to wait to see a good time being displayed by the clock, or -1 if this can never happen.
