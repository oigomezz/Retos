# [The weighted graph][link]

You are given a complete graph with n nodes. There are two values associated with each node i, denoted by ai and bi.

The weight of the edge between two nodes i and j is denoted by wij = | aibi - ajbj |.

Find the sum of the square of weights of all the edges. Formally, find the value ΣΣ (wij)²

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer n.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,a2,a3,...,an.
- The third line contains n space-separated integers b1,b2,b3,...,bn.

## Output format

Print a single integer denoting the required value (mod 10⁹ + 7).
