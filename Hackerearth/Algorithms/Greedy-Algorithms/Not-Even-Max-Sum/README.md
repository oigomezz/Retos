# [Not Even Max Sum][link]

You are given an array A of size N where Ai is a positive integer at i-th position.. Find out the maximum sum of the elements that can be obtained which is not even. If the sum can never be not even return 0.

**Task** Find out the maximum sum of the elements that are not even.

## Function description

Complete the function solve provided in the editor. This function takes the following two-parameter and returns the required answer:

- N : number of elements in the array.
- A: a list containing positive integers.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains the integer N, the size of the array A.
  - The second line contains the N spaced positive integer values.

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer in a new line.
