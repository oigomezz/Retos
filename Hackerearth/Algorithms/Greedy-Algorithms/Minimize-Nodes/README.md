# [Minimize nodes][link]

You are given N strings. Each string is given in the form of an array cnt of size 26 where the i-th element in array denotes the count of the i-th character of lowercase English alphabets in the string.

You have to select exactly 4 strings and insert the strings into a Trie. You are allowed to shuffle the characters in each string.

**Task:** Determine the minimum number of nodes present in Trie if the strings are selected optimally.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
- The next N lines of each test case contain 26 space-separated integers denoting the count of each lowercase English alphabet in the string.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum number of nodes present in Trie in a new line.
