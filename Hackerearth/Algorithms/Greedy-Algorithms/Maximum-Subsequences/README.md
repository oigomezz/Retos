# [Maximum subsequences][link]

Consider a string s of length n that consists of lowercase Latin alphabetic characters. You are given an array A of size 26 showing the value for each alphabet. You must output the subsequence of size k whose sum of values is maximum.

If there are multiple subsequences available, then print the lexicographically smallest sequence.

String p is lexicographically smaller than string q if p is a prefix of q and is not equal to q or there exists i, such that pi < qi and for all j < i it is satisfied that pj = qj.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, you are given two integers n and k, a string s, and an array A of length 26.

## Output format

Print a string for each test case.
