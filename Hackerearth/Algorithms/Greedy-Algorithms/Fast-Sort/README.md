# [Fast Sort][link]

From the childhood we are taught that a comes before b then b comes before c and so on.So whenever we try to sort any given string we sort it in that manner only placing a before b and so on.But what happens if we initially change the pattern of sorting .This question arrived in Arav's young mind. He thought what would the final string be like if z comes before a and a comes after c and so on. He got really puzzled in finding out the final sorted string.So he asks you for help.

He gives you two strings.One the pattern string P which decides the order of alphabets and the second that is the final string F which needs to be sorted. Help him by telling him the final sorted string.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines:
  - The first line contains the pattern string P indicating the relative ordering of alphabets.
  - The second line contains the final string F to be sorted.

## Output format

Print T lines where each line contains the sorted string.
