# [Chandu and his toy stack][link]

After setting up the area. Chandu wanted all his toys to be stacked there in that area. So that all of them are accessible easily. Currently, He is having N stacks of toys each with height H1, H2, ... , Hn (assuming all toys are of same height).Chandu did not like the configuration much and want to change the height of each stack. To increase the height of a particular stack he can add some toys to it and to decrease the height he can take out some toys from that stack. Chandu, knows that he requires X units of effort for putting up an item onto the stack and Y units of effort for removing it. Help, chandu in setting up his toys.

## Input format

- First Line of input contains an integer t, which is the number of test cases.
- Then, t lines follow where:
  - First line of each test case contains three integers N, X and Y.
  - Then N lines follow containing two integers each ai and bi (Initial height of i-th stack and final height of i-th stack.)

## Output format

Output an integer which is the minimum effort required.
