# [Likeable arrays][link]

Bob and Alice are two friends, they have an array A consisting of N integers, A1, A2, ..., AN. Alice likes the arrays in which if element X is present it must have exactly X or zero occurrences. So, Bob has decided to convert this array to an array which Alice likes. To do that, he can perform the following two operations:

- Add an element of any value to array A.
- Remove an element from array A.

Find the minimum number of operations Bob has to perform so that array is liked by Alice.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in array A.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers of array A.

## Output format

Print T lines. For each test case:

- Print a single line indicating the minimum number of operations to be performed.
