# [Bob And The Tasks][link]

Bob has been assigned N tasks arranged in a row, and in one day, he can perform one task. So, to perform all of the N tasks, he will take N days.

He has been given an array A containing N integers where A[i] = X denotes that on the i-th day he has to perform the X-th task.

Bob has been given an integer K and has to tell the minimum days he will take to reach the configuration where there are exactly K tasks between a pair of completed tasks, and all these K tasks are not completed.

Help Bob to find the minimum days to reach the configuration mentioned above or print -1 if it's impossible.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two spaced integers, N and K.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum days to reach the configuration mentioned in the problem statement. Print -1 if it's impossible.
