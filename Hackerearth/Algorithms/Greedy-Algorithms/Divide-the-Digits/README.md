# [Divide the digits][link]

You are given a number N.

You are required to form two numbers X and Y such that:

- The sum of frequency of each digit in X and Y is equal to frequency of that digit in N.
- The sum of numbers X and Y must be minimum.

Your task is to determine the minimum possible sum of X and Y.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T that denotes the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer N.

## Output format

For each test case, you are required to print the minimum possible sum of X and Y in a new line.
