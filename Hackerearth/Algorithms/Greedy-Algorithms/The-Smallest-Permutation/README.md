# [The smallest permutation][link]

You are given an array A of N elements which is a permutation. You are required to perform the following operation exactly one time:

- Select two different indices i and j (1 <= i < j <= N) and swap elements at these indices.

Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest array A you can achieve.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in array A.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers of array A.

## Output format

Print T lines. For each test case:

- Print a single line containing N integers which is a lexicographically smallest permutation A after applying the operation exactly once.
