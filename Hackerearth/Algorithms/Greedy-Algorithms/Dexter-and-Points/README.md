# [Dexter and Points][link]

Dexter has you on his kill table now. He gives you one last chance to survive. He gives you a problem to solve. If you solve the problem correctly, he will let you go, else he will kill you.

You are given N integers a1, a2, ..., an. Consider an N-dimensional hyperspace. Let (x1,x2,...,xn) be a point in this hyperspace and all xi for i ∈ [1,N] are integers. Now, Dexter gives you a set which contains all the points such that for [1,N]. Find the number of ways to select two points A and B from this set, such that the midpoint of A and B also lies in this set.

As the required number can be really large, find the answer modulo 10⁹ + 7.

**Note:** The two selected points can be same.

## Input format

- First line of input contains a single integer N, representing the number of dimensions in the hyperspace.
- The second line contains N integers, the i-th of them representing ai, as defined in the problem.

## Output format

The output contains a single integer, the answer to the problem, modulo 10⁹ + 7.
