# [A bitwise pair][link]

You are given an array A of N positive integers. Find the number of pairs (i,j) such that:

- (A[i] | A[j]) - (A[i] & A[j]) = (A[i] - A[j]), where | is a bitwise OR operator and & is a bitwise AND operator.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integer denoting array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the number of pairs, in a new line, satisfying the equation.
