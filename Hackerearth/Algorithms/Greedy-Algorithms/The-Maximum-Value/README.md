# [The maximum value][link]

You are given an integer N. For each integer i from 2 to N, assign a positive integer A[i] such that the following conditions hold:

- For any pair of integers (i,j), if i and j are co-prime, then A[i] != A[j].
- The maximum value among all A[i] is the minimum possible.

Find the maximum value among all A[i]'s.

**Note:** A pair of integers (i,j) is said to be co-prime when the greatest common divisor between them is 1.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line for each test case contains N denoting an integer.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum value among all A[i]'s in a new line.
