2. It can be divided into K contiguous substrings such that the first letter of these substrings is distinct for all the substrings.

Print YES if S is a split string otherwise print NO.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers N and K.
