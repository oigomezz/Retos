# [Easy Strong Permutation][link]

Kevin has a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an.

Define the strength of the sequence to be |a1 - a2| + |a2 - a3| + ... + |an-1 - an| + |an - a1|.

Kevin wants to make his sequence stronger, so he reorders his sequence into a new sequence b1, b2, ..., bn. He wants this new sequence to be as strong as possible. What is the largest possible strength of the resulting sequence?

## Input format

The input consists of 2 lines:

- The first line has a positive integer n.
- The second line contains the n integers a1, a2, ..., an.

## Output format

Output a single integer: the maximum possible strength.
