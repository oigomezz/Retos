# [Legendary Magician][link]

Legendary magician, Dynamo has a special magic trick that he wants to show to every student in College. But as this is placement time, every student is busy with preparation, so everyone can't be present at the magic show at the same time. There are N students in college, and the i-th student reaches the magic show at a time Ai and leaves at time Bi. As special trick is so special, he doesn't want to play it frequently.
