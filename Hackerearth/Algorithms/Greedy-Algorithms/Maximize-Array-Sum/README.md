# [Maximize Array Sum][link]

You are given an array A of size N. You can fix any element, say K of the array and all the elements in the array greater than or equal to K become K and all the elements less than K multiplied by -1. You have to find the maximum sum of the array after fixing K.

## Input format

- The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
- For each Test case:
  - The first line contains an integer N, size of the array.
  - The second line contains N space-separated integers, the i-th of which is Ai.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum sum of the array by fixing an element K. Answer for each test case should come in a new line.
