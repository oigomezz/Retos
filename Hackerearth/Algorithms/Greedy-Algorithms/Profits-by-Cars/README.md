# [Profits by cars][link]

You are a car seller. You have N cars and the profit for each of the cars is given by an array P. The profit of cars are P1, P2, ..., Pn. Since you got a huge profit in the last month so you decide to get (N-1) more sets of such cars. You already have one car. Now, you have NÂ² cars. Basically, there are N number of cars of each profit such as N cars for profit P1, N cars of profit P2, and so on up to N cars of profit Pn.

You can perform the following operations any number of times:

- If the last car is sold for profit P, then you can sell a car for profit Pc > P.

**Note:** You can select a car of any profit in the first operation as there are no cars that are sold earlier.

Find out the maximum profit that you can make.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case consists of an integer N.
- The second line consists of N space-separated integers P1, P2, ..., Pn.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single integer denoting the maximum amount of profit that you can make.
