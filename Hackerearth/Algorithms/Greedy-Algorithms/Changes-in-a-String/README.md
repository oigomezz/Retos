You are given a string S of N characters comprising of A's and B's. You can choose any index i and change Si to either A or B.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of changes such that string S has x number of A's in the beginning, followed by the remaining (n - x) number of B's.

## Input format

- First line: A single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - First line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the string.
  - Second line contains string S.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer that represents the minimum number of changes you need to make in string S as mentioned in the question.
