# [Swap Sum][link]

You are given two arrays, A and B of length N. In one operation, you can swap A[i] and B[i]. Find the maximum sum of A after performing at most K operations.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers, N and K.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, elements of array A.
- The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, elements of array B.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum sum of A after performing at most K operations in a new line.
