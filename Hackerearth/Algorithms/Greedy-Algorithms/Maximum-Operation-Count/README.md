# [Maximum Operation Count][link]

We have given an array nums of integers of size N and a positive integer K. We can perform as many operations on the array till it has at least two elements.

The operation is as follows: you can pick any two numbers from the array and remove both if the difference between them is at least K.

Find the maximum number of times we can perform this operation on the array.

## Input format

- The first line contains two space-separated integers N and K.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting array nums.

## Output format

Print the maximum possible number of operations.
