# [Mathison and the funny subarray][link]

Mathison has been playing quite a lot with some array A of length N. A subarray of the given array is called funny if it starts and ends with the same number.

Your task is to find the length of the longest funny subarray of the given array.

## Input format

- The first line of the input file contains an integer, N, representing the number of integers in the given array.
- The second line of the input file contains N space-separated integers, where the i-th integer represents Ai.

## Output format

The output file should contain only one integer, the length of the longest funny subarray.
