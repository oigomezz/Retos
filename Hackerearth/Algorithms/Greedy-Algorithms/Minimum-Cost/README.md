# [Minimum Cost][link]

You are given an array of N integers and your task is to sort the array using the following operations.

In one operation you can select a sub-array of the array and sort it. The cost of performing such an operation will be the square of the length of the sub-array you are sorting.

Your task is to find the minimum cost of sorting the whole array.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T representing the number of test cases. Then each test case follows.
- The first line of each test case contains one integers N denoting the number of elements in the array.
- The next line of each test case contains N integers of the array.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum cost required to sort the whole array.
