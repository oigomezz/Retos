# [Zero subarray][link]

Given an array A of N elements. You can apply the given operations on array A.

- Type 1: Choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and set A[i] = A[i] - 1.
- Type 2: Choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and set A[i] = 0.

Find the maximum length subarray in array ​A​​​​​​ where all the elements in the subarray is 0 by using at most X operations of Type 1 and Y operations of Type 2.

**Note** Assume 1-based indexing.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains 3 space-separated integers N, X, Y.
  - Next line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of array A.

## Output format

For each test case in a new line, print the maximum length subarray in A where all the elements in the subarray is 0.
