# [Average Subarray][link]

You are given an binary array A of N integers. You are also given an integer K and you need to ensure that no subarray of size greater than or equal to K has average 1.

For this you can perform the below operation:

- Choose any index and flip the bit.

Find the minimum number of operations to acheive the above condition.

## Input format

- First line contains number of test cases T. For each test case:
  - First line contains two space seperated integers N and K.
  - Second line contains N space separated integers of the binary array.

## Output format

Print T lines, one for each test case. For each test case:

- Print a single line denoting the minimum number of operations that needs to be performed.
