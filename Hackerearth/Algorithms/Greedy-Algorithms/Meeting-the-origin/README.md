# [Meeting the origin][link]

You are given a string path S which consists of only four characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'. You are initially at origin (0,0). You have to follow the directions as provided in path S in order. For 'L' you have to move 1 unit left, for 'R' move 1 unit right, for 'U' move 1 unit up and for 'D' move 1 unit down.

You can do these operations any number of times:

- Delete any single move and remove it from the string path S.
- Convert any single move 'L' to 'R' or vice-versa.
- Convert any single move 'U' to 'D' or vice-versa.

Print the minimum operations required, after which going through the new path, you will meet the origin again.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case, you are given a string S that denotes the path.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum operations required in a new line.
