# [The smallest string][link]

You are given a string S which consists of lower case Latin letters and you need to perform the following operation exactly K times:

    Select any character and replace it with its next character ['a' with 'b', 'b' with 'c'.... 'z' with 'a'].

You need to find the lexicographically smallest string after performing exactly K operations on string S.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the length of string S and the number of operations to be performed respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains string S consisting of lower case Latin letters.

## Output format

Print T lines. For each test case, print a single lexicographic string S after performing exactly K operations.
