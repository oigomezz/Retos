# [Bob's empire][link]

Bob built an empire with five cities (C1,C2,C3,C4,C5). The only mode of transport in this empire is the train.

1. One can travel from C1 to C2 in one minute. This train can occupy at most A people.
2. One can travel from C2 to C3 in one minute. This train can occupy at most B people.
3. One can travel from C3 to C4 in one minute. This train can occupy at most C people.
4. One can travel from C4 to C5 in one minute. This train can occupy at most D people.

For each of them, a train leaves the city at each integer time (0,1,2,...).

There is a group of N people at C1, and they all want to go to C5.

At least how long does it take for all of them to reach there? You can ignore the time needed to transfer.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
- The second line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, C, and D respectively.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum time required for all of the people to reach C5 (in minutes) in a new line.
