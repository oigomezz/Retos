# [( Problem A ) Pikachu and the Game of Strings][link]

Pikachu has recently learnt a new move s. He knows he can work hard and convert it into a stronger move t. Both the moves s and t contain the same number of letters.

In a single day, Pikachu can increase any letter of move s by one, that is, in a single day, he can convert letter A to B, C to D, M to N and so on. He can also convert letter Z to letter A.

Pikachu just realized he also has a hidden ability. It can help him increase any letter of move s by 13, that is, in a single day, he can convert letter A to letter N, B into O, M into Z, O into B and so on.

Now Pikachu wants to know the minimum number of days in which he can convert the move s into move t ?

## Input format

- First line contains an integer n, the length of strings s and t.
- Second line contains string s of length n.
- Third line contains string t of length n.

## Output format

Output single line containing the minimum number of days required
