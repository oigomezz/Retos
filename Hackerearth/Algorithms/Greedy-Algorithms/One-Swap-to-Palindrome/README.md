# [One Swap to Palindrome][link]

You are given T tasks to perform. In each task, you are given a string S of length N. You are allowed to select any two indices i and j (i!=j) of the given string and perform exactly one swap between the characters at these indices.

If it is possible to make the new string a palindrome then print "Yes", else print "No".

**Note:** A string is said to be palindrome if it reads same as its reverse form. For example: "madam" , "dad" etc.

## Input format

- First line contain an integer T denoting total number of tasks to perform.
- Each of the following T lines contains a string S.

## Output format

For each task, print a single line with "Yes" if it is possible to make palindrome otherwise print "No" without any quotes.
