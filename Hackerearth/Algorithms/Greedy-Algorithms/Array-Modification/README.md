# [Array Modification][link]

You are given an array A of N integers. For every index i of the array A, you need to select an index j such that j != i and the product of Ai and Aj is maximum for that i. Finally, you need to print the sum of Ai \* Aj for all the indices i. Since this sum can be large, you need to print it to the modulo 10⁹ + 7.

**Note:** Please refer to the sample explanation section.

## Input format

- First line: Integer N denoting the number of elements in the array A.
- Next line: N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array A.

## Output format

Print the required sum to the modulo 10⁹ + 7.
