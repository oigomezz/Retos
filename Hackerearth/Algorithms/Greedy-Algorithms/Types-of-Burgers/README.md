# [Types of burgers][link]

Bob sells burgers with three different combinations, B1, B2 and B3. There are total X, Y, and Z burgers with combinations, B1, B2, and B3 respectively. Each burger has an integer value called deliciousness as follows:

- The deliciousness of the burgers with the B1 combination are B11,B12,B13,...,B1X.
- The deliciousness of the burgers with the B2 combination are B21,B22,B23,...,B2Y.
- The deliciousness of the burgers with the B3 combination are B31,B32,B33,...,B3Z.

Alice decides to buy K boxes containing three burgers, one from each of the combinations. The deliciousness of a box is the sum of the deliciousness of the burgers present inside it.

There are X \* Y \* Z such ways to select a box. Print the maximum total sum of deliciousness that Alice can get by buying K boxes.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers X, Y, and Z.
- The second line of each test case contains a single integer K.
- The third line of each test case contains X space-separated integers denoting array B1i.
- The fourth line of each test case contains Y space-separated integers denoting array B2j.
- The fifth line of each test case contains Z space-separated integers denoting array B3k.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum total sum of deliciousness that Alice can get by buying K boxes in a new line.
