# [Stay Healthy!][link]

You have N pills of characteristic values a1,a2,..., an.

On each day i you can take the i-th pill and increase your health by ai points H := H + ai or Do nothing and take 1 point of damage H := H - 1, where H is a value deenoting your health. You die if your health becomes zero. Initially H = V (where V is a value given in the input).

What is the minimum number of pills you should take to survive for N days.

## Input format

- Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t, the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers N and V.
- The second line of each test case contains N space seperated integers a1, a2, ..., an

**Note** The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 200000.

## Output format

For each test case print the minimum number of pills you should take to survive for N days.
