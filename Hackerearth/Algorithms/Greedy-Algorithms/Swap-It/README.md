# [Swap It][link]

Bob loves sorting very much. He is always thinking of new ways to sort an array.His friend Ram gives him a challenging task.He gives Bob an array and an integer K .The challenge is to produce the lexicographical minimal array after at most K-swaps.Only consecutive pairs of elements can be swapped.Help Bob in returning the lexicographical minimal array possible after at most K-swaps.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T i.e. the number of Test cases.
- T test cases follow. Each test case has 2 lines:
  - The first line contains N(number of elements in array) and K(number of swaps).
  - The second line contains n integers of the array.

## Output format

Print the lexicographical minimal array.
