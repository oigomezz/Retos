# [Minimum Cabs][link]

Assume there are N persons and each person needs exactly one cab. For each person, you are given the start time and end time (both inclusive) during which that person will travel. Find the minimum number of cabs required.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer, N denoting the number of persons.
- Next N lines contains 4 integers, HH1, MM1, HH2 and MM2, (0 <= HH1,HH2 <= 23) (0 <= MM1,MM2 <= 59), denoting the start time (HH1:MM1) and end time (HH2:MM2). It is guaranteed that start and end time will not span midnight.

## Output format

Print the minimum number of cabs required.
