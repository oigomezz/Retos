# [K Friends][link]

Monk has N friends. They are invited to his birthday party. Each friend has a satisfying factor which is equal to the number of gifts which they are expecting. Monk wants to satisfy at-least K friends but he is unaware of their satisfying factors. So Monk starts distribution of gifts. As soon as a friend is satisfied he won't take more gifts.

Monk will follow a distribution strategy so as to minimize the number of gifts needed to satisfy atleast K of his friends. Find the minimum number of gifts which Monk should carry with himself in the worst case.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer T (the number of testcases).
- Then first line of each test case contains an integer N (the number of friends).
- Then N space separated integers follow which are the satisfying factor(Si).
- Last line of each test case consists of an integer K.

## Output format

For each case print in a new line the minimum number of gifts that Monk should carry.
