# [Bob's Quest][link]

Bob has an array A of size N, and he is very fond of two integers X and Y. Find the length of the longest subarray, such that it contains exactly X distinct integers and Y exist at least once in the subarray.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains three space separated integers N,X,Y denoting the size of array A, the value of X and Y, respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the length of the largest subarray, such that it contains exactly distinct integers and exist at least once in the subarray in a new line.
