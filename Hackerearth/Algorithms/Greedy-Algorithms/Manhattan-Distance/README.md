# [Manhattan distance][link]

There are N towns in a coordinate plane. Town i is located at coordinate (xi,yi). The distance between town i and town j is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|. Your task is to compute the sum of the distance between each pair of towns.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the total number of towns.
- Next N lines contain two space-separated integers xi and yi denoting a town at coordinate (xi, yi).

## Output format

For each test case, print the sum of the distance between each pair of towns in a new line.
