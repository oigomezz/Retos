# [Bob's confusion][link]

You are given a 3 x 3 grid. Each number in the grid is represented by Cij where (i,j) denotes the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.

Bob gets confused. According to him, there are six integers a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3 whose values are fixed and the number written in the square (i,j) is equal to ai + bj. You are required to determine whether Bob is correct or not.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Next three lines contain three space-separated integers Ci1, Ci2, and Ci3 denoting the i-th row of grid C.

## Output format

For each test case, print YES if Bob's statement is correct. Otherwise, print NO in a new line.
