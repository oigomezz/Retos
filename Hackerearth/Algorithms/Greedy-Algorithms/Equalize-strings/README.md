# [Equalize strings][link]

You are given two binary strings S and T of the same length N. Your task is to make both the strings equal. Perform the following operation on string S:

    Select any substring of S then flip all 1's to 0 and flip all 0's to 1 of that substring.

Print the minimum number of operations you have to perform to make them equal.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer N size of each string.
- The second line contains a string S of length N.
- The third line contains a string T of length N.

## Output format

Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of operations required to make both the strings equal.
