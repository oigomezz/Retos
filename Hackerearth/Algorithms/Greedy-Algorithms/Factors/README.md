# [Factors][link]

Ben had two numbers M and N. He factorized both the numbers, that is, expressed M and N as a product of prime numbers.

- M = (P1A1)\*(P2A2 )\*(P3A3)\* … \*(PNAN)
- N = (Q1B1)\*(Q2B2 )\*(Q3B3)\*…\*(QNBN)

Here, \* represents multiplication.

- P1, P2 ...PN are distinct prime numbers.
- Q1, Q2 ...QN are distinct prime numbers.

Unfortunately, Ben has lost both the numbers M and N but still he has arrays A and B. He wants to reterive the numbers M and N but he will not be able to. Your task is to determine the minimum and the maximum number of factors their product (that is, M \* N) could have. Your task is to tell Ben the minimum and the maximum number of factors that the product of M and N could have.

Since the answer can be large, print modulo 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer denoting the number of test cases. For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in arrays A and B.
  - The second line contains N space-separated integers of array A.
  - The third line contains N space-separated integers of array B.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single line line containing two integers denoting the minimum and maximum number of factors which a product of M and N could have.
