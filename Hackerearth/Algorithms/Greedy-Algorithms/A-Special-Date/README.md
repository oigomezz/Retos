# [A special date][link]

A special birth date is D. Your task is to find the last palindrome date that comes before a date D.

You are given a date D in the string format. The date format is as follows:

- A valid date D is of length 8 and in the ddmmyyyy format.
- A valid date ranges between 01 to 30.
- A valid month ranges between 01 to 12.
- A valid year ranges between 0001 to 9999.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains a string D that denotes the special birth date.

## Output format

For each test case, print the valid palindrome date in a new line. If there is no possible palindrome date that comes before D, then print -1.
