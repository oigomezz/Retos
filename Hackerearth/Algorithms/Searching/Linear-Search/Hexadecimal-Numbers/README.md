# [Hexadecimal numbers][link]

You are given a range [L,R]. You are required to find the number of integers X in the range such that GCD(X,F(X)) > 1 where F(X) is equal to the sum of digits of X in its hexadecimal (or base 16) representation.

For example, F(27) = 1 + B = 1 + 11 = 12 (27 in hexadecimal is written as 1B). You are aksed T such questions.

## Input format

- The first line contains a positive integer T denoting the number of questions that you are asked.
- Each of the next T lines contain two integers L and R denoting the range of questions.

## Output format

For each test case, you are required to print exactly T numbers as the output.
