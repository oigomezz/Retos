# [Easy Sum Set Problem][link]

In this problem, we define "set" is a collection of distinct numbers. For two sets A and B, we define their sum set is a set S(A,B) = {a+b | a∈A, b∈B}. In other word, set S(A,B) contains all elements which can be represented as sum of an element in A and an element in B. Given two sets A,C your task is to find set B of positive integers less than or equals 100 with maximum size such that S(A,B) = C. It is guaranteed that there is unique such set.

## Input format

- The first line contains N denoting the number of elements in set A.
- The following line contains N space-separated integers A[i] denoting the elements of set A.
- The third line contains M denoting the number of elements in set C.
- The following line contains M space-separated integers C[i] denoting the elements of set C.

## Output format

Print all elements of B in increasing order in a single line, separated by space.
