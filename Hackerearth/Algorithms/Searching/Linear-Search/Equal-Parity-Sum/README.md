# [Equal Parity Sum][link]

You are given an array A[1...N] containing N integers. You can apply the following operation atmost once :

- Choose a subarray A[i...j] with 1 <= i <= j <= N and multiply -1 to all elements of the subarray.

Find if it possible to make the sum of integers on the odd indices of A equal to the sum of integers on the even indices.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows:
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of array A.
  - The second line contains N integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] - denoting the elements of A.

## Output format

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to achieve to requied goal, otherwise print NO in a separate line.
