# [Holiday Season][link]

It's a holiday season for all school students around the world! Unfortunately, Mahamba is busy preparing for International Olympiad in Informatics, which will be held in Tehran, Iran. He is now facing a new challenge from his teacher Aceka, and it goes something like this:

You have a string x of length N, which consists of small English letters. You have to find the number of indexes a, b, c and d, such that 1 <= a < b < c < d <= N and x[a] == x[c], as well as x[b] == x[d].

He is baffled and definitely needs some help. So, you, the best programmer in Lalalandia, decided to give him a hand!

## Input format

- The first line contains the number N - the length of a string x.
- The second line contains the string x itself.

## Output format

The first and only line should contain the answer to the problem.
