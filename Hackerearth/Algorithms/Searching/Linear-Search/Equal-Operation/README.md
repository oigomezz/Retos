# [Equal Operation][link]

You are given an array A containing N integers. You can apply the following operation on the array:

- Choose an index i (1 <= i <= |A|), split A[i] into two positive integers X,Y such that A[i] = X + Y, remove the i-th element from the array and append the elements X,Y to the array.

Find the minimum number of operations required to make all integers of the array equal.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows:
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of array A.
  - The second line contains N integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] - denoting the elements of A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum number of operations required to make all integers of the array equal.
