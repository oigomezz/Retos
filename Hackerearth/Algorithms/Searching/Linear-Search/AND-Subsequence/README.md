# [AND Subsequence][link]

You are given an array A having N integers and an integer X. Find the length of the longest non-empty subsequence of the array A such that the Bitwise AND of the elements of the subsequence is greater than or equal to X. Print -1 if no such subsequence exists.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows:
- The first line of each test case contains two integers N and X.
- The second line of each test case contains N integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].

## Output format

For each test case, print -1 if no subsequence satisfies the given condition. Otherwise, print the length of the longest non-empty subsequence in a separate line.
