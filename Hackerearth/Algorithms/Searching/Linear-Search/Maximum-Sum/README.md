# [Maximum Sum][link]

You are given an array of integers A, you need to find the maximum sum that can be obtained by picking some non-empty subset of the array. If there are many such non-empty subsets, choose the one with the maximum number of elements. Print the maximum sum and the number of elements in the chosen subset.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of elements of the array.
- Next line contains N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.

## Output format

Print 2 space-separated integers, the maximum sum that can be obtained by choosing some subset and the maximum number of elements among all such subsets which have the same maximum sum.
