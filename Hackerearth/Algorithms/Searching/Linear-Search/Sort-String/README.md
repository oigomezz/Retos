# [Sort String][link]

You are given a binary string S of length N. You can apply the following operation to the string S:

- Choose two distinct indices i,j (1 <= i, j <= N, i != j) and flip the characters S[i], S[j].

Find the minimum number of operations required to sort the given string S. It is always possible to sort any string under the given constraints.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows:
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains N denoting the length of string S.
  - The second line contains the binary string S.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum number of operations required to sort the given string S.
