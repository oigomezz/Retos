# [Gaurav And Sub-array][link]

You are given an array A consisting of N non-negative integers. Now, you need to answer Q queries of the following type given an integer K in each query.

You need to find the minimum length L of any subarray of A, such that if all elements of this subarray are represented in binary notation and concatenated to form a binary string, then no of 1's in the resulting string is at least K.

## Input format

- The first line of the input consists of two space-separated integers N and Q.
- The second line contains N space separated integers, where the i-th integer denotes A[i].
- Next Q lines contains a non-negative integer K.

## Output format

For each query out of the Q ones, print the answer on a new line. If for a paritcular query no valid subarray exists, then print -1 instead as the answer to that query.
