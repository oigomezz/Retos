# [Random Generator][link]

Aparna recently created a random number generator and now she wants Harsh to check if it works fine. She gives Harsh an array containing N numbers generated from this random number generator of hers, and two integers K and P. If the given array contains more than or equal to K numbers in the range X-P to X+P (both inclusive) for any integer X, then the random generator fails.

If for any X the generator fails then ultimately it fails.

Help Harsh in determining whether the random generator works well or not.

## Input format

- The first line contains T indicating the number of test cases.
- Second line contains 3 space separated integers N, K and P.
- The next line contains N integers generated by the random number generator.

## Output format

For each Test Case Print 'YES' if random generator works correctly else print 'NO'. (Quotes for clarity)
