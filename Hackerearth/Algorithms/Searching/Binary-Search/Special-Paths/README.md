# [Special paths][link]

You are given an undirected connected graph G with N nodes and M edges. Every node has a value A[i] assigned to it.

The value of a simple path between node u and v is as follows:

- The maximum absolute difference between the values of adjacent nodes present in the simple path.

Find the minimum possible path value of any simple paths between start and end nodes.

## Input format

- The first line contains two space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of nodes and edges respectively.
- Next M lines contain two space-separated integers denoting edges.
- The next line contains N space-separated integers denoting node values.
- The next line contains two space-separated integers denoting the start ends.

## Output format

Print the minimum possible path value of any simple path between start and end nodes.
