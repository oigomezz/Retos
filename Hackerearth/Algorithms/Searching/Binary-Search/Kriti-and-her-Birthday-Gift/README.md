# [Kriti and her Birthday Gift][link]

Today is Kriti's birthday but I forgot to bring a gift for her. She is very angry with me. I have an idea for a gift. She likes coding very much. Why not give her a problem to solve as her gift?

I know a problem but I am not sure whether its solvable or not.

The problem initially has N strings numbered 1 to N. The program has to answer Q queries. Each query is of the form l r S. For each query, the program has to print the number of times the string S appears in the range [l,r].Help me by solving the problem!!

## Input format

- Input will begin with an integer N denoting the number of strings.
- N lines follows each having a string.
- The next line contains Q denoting the number of queries.
- Each of the next Q lines contain a query of the form l r S.

## Output format

For each query of type l r S, print the answer to that query. Each answer must be in a new line.
