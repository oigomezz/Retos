# [The furious five][link]

You are given an integer N.

Write a program to find a minimum number P such that 1 <= X <= P, Σ F(X) >= N (where F(X) represents the number of times X can be divided by 5).

## Input format

- First line: T (Number of test cases)
- First line in each test case: N

## Output format

For each test case, print a minimum number P such that 1 <= X <= P, Σ F(X) >= N (where F(X) represents the number of times X can be divided by 5).
