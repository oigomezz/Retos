# [Longest Subsequence Queries][link]

You are given a positive integer array A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] of length N and Q queries. In each query, given an positive integer K find the length of the longest subsequence with sum of elements less than K?

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q, denoting the length of the array A, and the number of queries.
- The second line of each test case contains n positive integers â€” elements of A.
- Then q lines follow, each line contains a single positive integer for corresponding query.

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer for each query in a new line.
