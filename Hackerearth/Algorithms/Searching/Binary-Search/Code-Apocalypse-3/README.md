Cypher guys are ready for the grand event Code Apocalypse!!.

Questions are prepared, Promotions just begun ( from this question, LOL! ). But there is one problem they are facing. What should they do if there is a tie on the final day.
To solve this dilemma, Ayush came up with a tie breaker problem (although this can't be disclosed), give a try to solve it :

You have an army of N unsullied soldiers, you can upgrade a soldier to be stronger by feeding him X magical apples (found beyond the wall!). Initially, you have M magical apples.
You can buy extra magical apples ( from the Iron Bank! :P ), by selling one of your soldiers for Y apples.
Calculate what is maximum number of upgraded soldiers you can have for the long night.

**NOTE:** You can upgrade a soldier once only, and, You cannot sell an upgraded soldier.

## Input format

- First Line consists of single integer T denoting number of testcases.
- Next T lines, consists of four integers, N, M, X, Y, denoting:
  - number of soldiers intially,
  - number of magical apples initially,
  - number of apples needed to upgrade one soldier, and
  - number of apples for which a soldier can be sold respectively.

## Output format

For each testcase, print a single integer denoting the maximum number of soldiers which can be upgraded.
