# [Candies][link]

You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters denoting different types of candies. A substring of a string S is a string S' that occurs in S. For example, "bam" is a substring of "babammm". Each candy costs 1 unit. You can pick some continuous candies such that you can create a palindrome of length K by using some or all picked candies. Your task is to find the minimum cost to create a palindrome of length K.

## Input format

- First line contains string S.
- Next line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Next T lines contain a single integer K.

## Output format

For each test case, print minimum cost as mentioned above. If you cannot create a palindrome of length K then, simply print -1.
