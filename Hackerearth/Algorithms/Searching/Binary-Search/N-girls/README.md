You are given n boxes and the size of the i-th box is a[i]. You can select at most k boxes and change their size to a positive integer.

Select some boxes and paint it with the Red color. These boxes must satisfy the following condition:

- There must be no 1 <= i,j <= N such that both i,j boxes are red and (a[i]/a[j]) > (P/Q).

Determine the maximum number of boxes that you can color in Red.

## Input format

- First line: Four integers n,k,P and Q.
- Second line: Sequence a[1], a[2], ..., a[N]

## Output format
