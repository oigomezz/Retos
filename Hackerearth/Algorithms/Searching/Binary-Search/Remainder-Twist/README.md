# [Remainder Twist][link]

Alice is in love with remainders. His friend Bob gifted her the number R.

A function F(X) is defined as the number of possible pairs (A,B) such that the following conditions are satisfied:

- A and B are positive integers less than or equal to N.
- A % B, the remainder when A is divided by B, is greater than or equal to X.

Find the maximum possible non-negative integer Y, such that F(Y) is greater than or equal to R. If it is impossible to find such an integer, print -1.

## Input format

- The first line specifies a number T denoting the number of test cases.

## Output format

- The first line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers, N and R.
