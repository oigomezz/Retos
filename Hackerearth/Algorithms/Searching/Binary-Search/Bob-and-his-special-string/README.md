# [Bob and his special string][link]

Bob is very fond of strings so he is creating a new type of string. Help him in creating his new special string.

You are given a string s of length |s| and an integer n. Now, you are required to find a string str of length at most n such that if you add this string x number of times (str + str + ...x times) let us say it is xstr, then the frequency of each character in xstr string should be greater than or equal to the frequency of the same character in the string s. xstr should cover all the characters of string s.

Help Bob in finding the minimum possible value of x.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer n representing the maximum length of string that Bob can write.
- The second line contains a string s representing the given string.

## Output format

Print an integer denoting the minimum possible value of x.
