# [A digit in a sequence][link]

Bob is writing a program that solves the following problem:

You are given the numbers a,b to display the infinite sequence of numbers a, a + b, a + 2\*b, ..., a + N\*b, a + (N+1)\* b, ...,. Bob has made a mistake, he namely forgot to draw a space for the division between the numbers, resulting in a long line of numbers. In order not to correct the mistake, Bob decided to find out how to find the k-th digit in the formed line (numbering of digits begins with one).

Bob could not find a good solution, so he asks you for help.

## Input format

- The first line contains a number T denoting the number of tests.
- The first line of each test contains four integers a,b,k.

## Output format

Print the k-th digit for each test.
