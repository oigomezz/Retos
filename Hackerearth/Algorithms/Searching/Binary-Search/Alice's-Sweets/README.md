# [Alice's Sweets][link]

Alice has three different types of sweets. There are N sweets of each type, and each sweet has a tastiness value. The tastiness values for sweets are given in three arrays A, B, and C. The tastiness value of two sweets of a particular type can differ.

Alice wants to choose three sweets, exactly one of each type. Let the chosen sweetsâ€™ tastiness values be
a, b, and c. You need to choose the sweets such that the value of the equation abs(a-b) + abs(b-c) + abs(c-a) is minimized. Here, abs(x) is the absolute value function.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer N denoting the number of sweets of each type.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the array A.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers denoting the array B.
- The fourth line contains N space-separated integers denoting the array C.

## Output format

Print the minimum value of the equation mentioned in the problem statement if we can choose exactly one sweet of each type.
