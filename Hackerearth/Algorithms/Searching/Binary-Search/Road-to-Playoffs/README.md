In a football championship, N teams are competing against each other on the league stage. The current number of points of each team are X1, X2, X3....XN. M days of league stage are remaining and on each day K teams win and each of the winning team's points is incremented by 1. Top B teams will qualify for the playoffs in the championship. Officials of the tournament want to how many teams have a non-zero probability of making it to the playoffs.

**Note:** If points of certain teams are equal, any of the teams can qualify for playoffs and each team has equal probability.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case:
- The first line contains four space-separated integers N, M, K, and B.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers X1, X2, X3...XN.

## Output format

Print T integers. For each test case:

- Print the number of teams that have a non-zero probability of making it to the playoffs.
