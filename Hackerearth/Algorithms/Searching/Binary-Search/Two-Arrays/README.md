# [Two Arrays][link]

Let's define the matching number for two arrays X and Y, each with size N, as the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that Xi = Yj (1 <= i,j <= N).

You are given an integer K and two arrays A and B with sizes N and M respectively. Find the number of ways to pick two subarrays with equal size, one from array A and the other from array B, such that the matching number for these two subarrays is >= K.

**Note:** a subarray consists of one or more consecutive elements of an array.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers N, M and K.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].
- The third line contains M space-separated integers B[1], B[2], ..., B[M].

## Output format

Print a single line containing one number denoting the number of ways to choose the pair of subarrays.
