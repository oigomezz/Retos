# [Monk and Chocolates][link]

Monk loves to eat chocolates. Out of his love for chocolates, he went to Chocoland. Chocoland is an amazing place for chocolate lovers. There are many games played where prizes are given in form of chocolates. Monk being an avid choco fan decided to participate in one of the games.

In this game, we are given a string consisting of English letters. Each of these letters correspond to a unique chocolate. Now there are some rules in the game. A participant can change one of the letters in the sequence and make it to represent some other type of chocolate. This move is called a magic move. Each game has some fixed number of magic moves allowed and will be given in the question itself. We need to find the maximum length of consecutive characters of the string where all letters denote the same chocolate.

On correctly guessing the maximum length winner will be awarded those chocolates. Can you help Monk to win this contest?

## Input format

- In the first line T test cases will be given.
- For each of the test case:
  - In the first line two integers N,M will be given. N denotes the string length and M denotes the number of magic moves allowed.
  - In the second line, string of length N will be given which will only consist of Lower and Upper case English letters. Note that Upper and lower case letters denote different Chocolates types.

## Output format

For each of the test case, output the maximum length in a separate line.
