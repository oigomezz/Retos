# [Optimal Division][link]

You have an array A of length N. You have to divide the array into atmost M consecutive segments such that the maximum bitwise OR of these segments is minimum.

Find the minimum possible maximum Bitwise OR of these segments if you divide optimally.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line contains two integers, N and M.
- The next line contains N space-separated integers, elements of array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum possible maximum Bitwise OR of these segments if you divide optimally.
