# [Make Max Groups][link]

You are given N types of blocks.

There are A[i] blocks of the type i (0 <= i <= N -1).

You have to make groups of size K, such that no group has more than floor(K/2) blocks of the same type.

Find the maximum number of groups that you can make.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K which denotes the length of the array A and the size of the group.
- The second line of each test case contains N space separated positive integers, denoting elements of array A.

## Output format

An integer denoting the maximum number of groups that you can make satisfying the given condition.
