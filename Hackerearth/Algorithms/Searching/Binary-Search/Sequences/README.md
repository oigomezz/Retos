# [Sequences][link]

You are given two integers X and Y. Your task is to determine the sequence of real numbers with the minimum size such that the sum and product of the numbers in the sequence are X and Y respectively. Also, print the size of the sequence only.

If no such sequences exist, then print -1.

## Input format

- First line: t denoting the number of test cases.
- Next t lines: Two space-separated integers X and Y.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single line containing the answer.
