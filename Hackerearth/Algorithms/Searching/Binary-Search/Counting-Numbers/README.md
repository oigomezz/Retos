You are given an N-digit number X and Xk is the largest K-digit subtype of the number X.

You must answer M queries. Each query consists of two numbers K and L. The answer to the query is the L-th digit of the number Xk.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer X of length N.
- The second line contains number M.
- The next M lines contain two numbers Ki and Li denoting the parameters of the i-th query.

## Output format

The output must contain one line of length M in which the i-th character is a response to the i-th query.
