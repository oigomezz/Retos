# [Choose K Numbers][link]

You are given an array Arr of size N. You have to find the maximum value of K such that after choosing K numbers from the array the DiffValue of chosen numbers is less than or equal to S.

DiffValue for a set of integers is defined as the largest possible difference among any two integers of the set. However if you choose K numbers from the array, value of all the chosen numbers get multiplied by K.

Hence print two integers i.e the largest value of number K and largest possible DiffValue corresponding to value of K.

## Input format

- First line contains T i.e number of testcases.
- For each testcase:
  - First line contains two space separated integers denoting N and S and
  - The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the array.

## Output format

Print answer to each testcase in separate line. For each testcase print two space separated integers denoting the value of K and DiffValue.
