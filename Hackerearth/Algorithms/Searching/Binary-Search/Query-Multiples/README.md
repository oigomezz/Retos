# [Query multiples][link]

An array arr has indices numbered from 1 to N. You are given Q queries with two integers,i X in each.

Write a program to find the number of multiples of X in the array arr that falls between the i-th index and the end of the array.

## Input format

- First line: Two space-separated integers N and Q.
- Second line: N space-separated integers (denoting the array arr).
- Next Q lines: Two space-separated integers, i and X.

## Output format

For each query, print the number of multiples of X in the array arr that falls between the i-th index and the end of the array.
