# [Triangular Ranges][link]

Kuku recently learnt about triangular numbers. If you are not familiar with the triangular numbers follow this link first http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number. Ani thinks Kuku has not learnt it properly and start asking questions. But, As we all know kuku is one of the most intelligent on this planet. He answered each and every question correctly. This annoyed Ani and he geared up his question's level and started asking even harder questions. Kuku can't answer such big questions manually. So , He decided to write a computer program which can answer Ani's questions .

Kuku is good at mathematics but not at programming ( Dont Doubt His Intelligence ) . So,he hired you ( A World Class Programmer ) to write a computer program which can answer Ani's Questions with in time.

In Each question, Ani has given a range [L,R] and asked kuku to calculate numbers of such triplets [A,B,K] which follows

    A + B = K

where A,B are any two triangular numbers and K must be in an integers that belongs to given range [L,R] both inclusive.

**Note** Two triplets are considered to be different if they contain at least one different elements [A,B,K].

## Input format

- First line of input contains a single integer Q denoting the number of Ani's questions.
- Next Q lines of input contains two space separated integers L R each describing one question.

## Output format

Output consists of Q lines each containing answer to the corresponding question.
