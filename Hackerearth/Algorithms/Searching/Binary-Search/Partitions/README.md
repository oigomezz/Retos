# [Partitions][link]

You are given an array a of size n and two integers l and r. You have to find the number of partitions of array a such that the sum of elements in each partition lies between l and r (both inclusive). Since the answer can be large, find the answer modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.

## Input format

- First line contains 3 space separated denoting the values of n, l and r.
- Next line contains n space separated integers denoting the values of array a.

## Output format

Print the answer in a single line.
