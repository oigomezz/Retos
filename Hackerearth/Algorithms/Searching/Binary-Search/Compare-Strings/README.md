# [Compare Strings][link]

You have been given two strings, A and B (of length N each) and Q queries. The strings contain only 0s and/or 1s.

For every query, you are given an index i. You have to update the value at index i to 1 in string B and check if B is lexicographically equal to or larger than A or not. If yes, then print "YES" and if not, print "NO" (without quotes).

## Input format

- First line contains two space-separated integers N and Q.
- Next line contains the string A.
- Next line contains the string B.
- Next Q lines contains an integer i (1 - based indexing)

## Output format

For each query, print the desired output in a new line.
