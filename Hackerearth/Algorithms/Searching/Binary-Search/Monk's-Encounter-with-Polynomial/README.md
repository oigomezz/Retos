# [Monk's Encounter with Polynomial][link]

Our monk, while taking a stroll in the park, stumped upon a polynomial ( AX² + B X +C ) lying on the ground. The polynomial was dying! Being considerate, our monk tried to talk and revive the polynomial. The polynomial said:

    I have served my purpose, and shall not live anymore. Please fulfill my dying wish. Find me the least non-negative integer Xo, that shall make my value atleast K i.e., A(Xo)² + BXo + C >= K .

Help our Monk fulfill the polynomial's dying wish!

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T. T test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of four space-separated integers A, B, C and K.

## Output format

For each test case, output the answer in a new line.
