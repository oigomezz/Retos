# [Supertables][link]

Little Timmy is exceptionally good at math tables, so his maths teacher decided to make things a bit more interesting. His teacher takes two numbers A and B and merges the tables of A and B in sorted order (ascending order), removing the duplicates and thus creates supertable of A and B and asks Little Timmy the Nth number in the supertable.

Given A, B and N, calculate the Nth number in the supertable of A and B.

## Input format

- First line contains number of test cases T.
- Each test case contains three integers A, B and N.

## Output format

For each test case print the N-th number of the supertable.
