# [Maze maximum][link]

You are given a 2-D matrix A of size N x M, its elements are integers. We will assume that the rows of the matrix are numbered from top to bottom from 1 to N, the columns are numbered from left to right from 1 to M. We will denote the element on the intersecting of the i-th row and the j-th column as Aij.

Find the maximum possible value X, such that:

- There exists at least one row and one column where all the value of all the elements >= X.

## Input format

- First line contains two space-separated integers N,M - the number of rows and columns of the matrix.
- Next N lines contains M space-separated integers denoting the matrix.

## Output format

Print the value of X.
