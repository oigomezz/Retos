# [Mehta And Subarrays][link]

Mehta has to find the longest subarray whose sum is greater than equal to zero in a given array of length **N**. After he finds out the length of longest subarray, he has to report how many subarrays of such maximum length exist that satisfy the mentioned property.

**Note:** Subarray is defined as an array of contiguous numbers in a particular array. Subarray(A,B) has length (B-A+1) and consists of all numbers from index A to index B.

## Input format

- First Line of the input consists of a single integer N as described above.
- Next Line consists of N space separated integers.

## Output format

In a single line, output the maximum length and number of such subarrays having maximum length separated by a single space.In case, there is no such subarray having sum greater than equal to zero, simply print "-1" without quotes.
