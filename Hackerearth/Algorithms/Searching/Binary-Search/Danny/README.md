You are given a sequence of positive integers in the form of an array A of size N and a number K. Now, you need to perform a certain procedure over this sequence that is as follows:

1. For each pair (i,j), where 1 <= i < j <= N store in a list | A[i] - A[j] |.
2. Sort this list in non-decreasing order.
3. Print the K-th element of this list (1 indexed).

**Note** that X denotes the absolute value of any integer X.

## Input format

- The first line contains 2 space separated integers N and K respectively.
- The next line contains N space separated integers, where the i-th integer denotes A[i].

## Output format

Print the required answer on a single line.
