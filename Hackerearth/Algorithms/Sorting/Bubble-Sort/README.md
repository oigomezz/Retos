# TUTORIAL Bubble Sort

Sorting Algorithms are concepts that every competitive programmer must know. Sorting algorithms can be used for collections of numbers, strings, characters, or a structure of any of these types.

Bubble sort is based on the idea of repeatedly comparing pairs of adjacent elements and then swapping their positions if they exist in the wrong order.

Assume that A[] is an unsorted array of n elements. This array needs to be sorted in ascending order. The pseudo code is as follows:

```c
void bubble_sort( int A[ ], int n ) {
    int temp;
    for(int k = 0; k< n-1; k++) {
        // (n-k-1) is for ignoring comparisons of elements which have already been compared in earlier iterations

        for(int i = 0; i < n-k-1; i++) {
            if(A[ i ] > A[ i+1] ) {
                // here swapping of positions is being done.
                temp = A[ i ];
                A[ i ] = A[ i+1 ];
                A[ i + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Complexity:** The complexity of bubble sort is O(nÂ²) in both worst and average cases, because the entire array needs to be iterated for every element.
