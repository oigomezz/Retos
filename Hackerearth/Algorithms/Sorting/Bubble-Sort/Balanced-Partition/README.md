# [Balanced Partition][link]

There are n houses in the village Dholakpur. The location of each house in the village can be given as (xi,yi) in the Cartesian coordinate plane. There are hi persons living in the i-th house. Central electricity authority of the village is set to built a wire line across the village. The wire line is supposed to constructed in a way such that it is the north-east direction. In other words the wire line is parallel to the line y=x. Given that the construction of such line is considered to be effective only if the number of persons living in its left and right side are equal, can you tell if the construction of such wire line is possible?

**Note:** If the wire line passes through any house, the house is not considered in either half.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer t denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains n i.e the number houses in the village.
- Next n lines contains 3 space-separated integers xi,yi, and hi.

## Output format

Print t lines each containing a "YES" or "NO" (without quotes). i-th line corresponds to the answer of the i-th testcase.
