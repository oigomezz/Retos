# [Digit sum][link]

You are given a string of length 2N consisting of only digits from 0 to 9. You can make a move to choose an arbitrary position and replace the digit in that position with any digit from 0 to 9.

**Task:** Determine the minimum number moves required to make the sum of the first N digits equal to the sum of the N digits that follow.

**Note:** 1-based indexing is used.

## Function description

Complete the function solve provided in the editor. This function takes the following 2 parameters and returns the answer:

- N: Represents an integer denoting N
- S: Represents a string denoting S

## Input format

**Note:** This is the input format you must use to provide custom input (available above the Compile and Test button).

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. T also specifies the number of times you have to run the solve function on a different set of inputs.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer N.
  - The next line contains a string S of length 2N.

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer in a new line.
