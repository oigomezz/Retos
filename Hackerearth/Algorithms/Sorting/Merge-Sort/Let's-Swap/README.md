# [Let's swap][link]

Y is alone too and has a permutation p1,p2,...,pn of numbers from 1 to n.

Y thinks that a permutation p1,p2,...,pn beautifulness is defined as value of Î£ |pi - i|, 1 <= i <= N.

Y can swap two elements of the permutation at most once, what is the maximum beautifulness that Y can get?

## Input format

- First line contains only n.
- Second line contains the permutation p1,p2,...,pn separated by space.

## Output format

The only line of output contains an integer, maximum beautifulness that Y can get.
