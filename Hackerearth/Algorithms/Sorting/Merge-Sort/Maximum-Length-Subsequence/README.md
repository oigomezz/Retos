# [Maximum length subsequence][link]

You are given an array A consisting of N integers. A subsequence of the array is called good if every pair of elements in the subsequence have an absolute difference of at most 10.

**Task:** Determine the maximum possible length of good subsequence.

## Function description

Complete the function solve() which takes the following 2 parameters and returns an integer as the required answer:

- N: Represents an integer denoting the size of the array
- A: Represents an array of N integers

## Input format

**Note:** This is the input format you must use to provide custom input (available above the Compile and Test button).

- The first line contains an integer N.
- The second line contains an array A of N integers.

## Output format

Print the maximum possible length of good subsequence.
