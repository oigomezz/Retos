# [Fredo and Sums][link]

Fredo has an array A consisting of N elements. He wants to divide the array into N/2 pairs where each array element comes in exactly one pair. Say that pair i has elements Xi and Yi, he defines S as:

    S = Î£ abs(Xi - Yi)

He asks you to find the minimum and maximum value of S.

## Input format

- First line consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case:
  - First line consists of an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array.
  - Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array elements.

## Output format

For each test case, print the minimum and maximum sum (space separated). Answer for each test case should come in a new line.
