Puchi hates to carry luggage, but unfortunately he got a job to carry the luggage of his N friends in office. Each day, one of his N friends, gives him the luggage of a particular weight to carry. You will be given the weight of luggage of each friend in the array Weight, where Weighti is the weight of luggage of i-th friend carried by Puchi on i-th day.
