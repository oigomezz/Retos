# [Pro and Con List][link]

Ted: Robin, get me my legal pad. It's Pros and Cons Time!

There is a long list of n girls in front of Barney, and he is to calculate the optimal "happiness" he can find by selecting exactly 2 girls. (Why 2? No one knows!)

Ted, as a fan of pros and cons, suggests to make a list, a method for estimating the maximum happiness that Barney can achieve.

Each girl is characterized by two parameters:

- favour: if this girl is chosen, his happiness increases by this amount.
- anger: if this girl is not chosen, his happiness decreases by this amount.

Find the maximum "happiness" that Barney can obtain. Note that the answer is allowed to be negative.

## Input format

- The first line of input file contains an integer t, denoting the number of test cases to follow.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer n, as explained in statement.
- It is followed by n lines, each containing two space-seperated integers denoting the favour and anger of the ith girl.

## Output format

The output file should contain t lines, each containing answer for the test case.
