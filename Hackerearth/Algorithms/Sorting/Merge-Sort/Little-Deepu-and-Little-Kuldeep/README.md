# [Criminals: Little Deepu and Little Kuldeep][link]

Little Deepu and Little Kuldeep are world renowned criminals. But, they are not bad people at heart. (Oh, they are...) Anyway, their occupation is to smuggle drugs from one place to another. And both of them are partners in this occupation of theirs. But, now Little Deepu is an amateur drug seller, while Little Kuldeep is a professional at that.

So, every drug box Little Deepu packs has a value X, that is to say, if there are 5 packets, every packet has some high quantity of a given number. A packet can fit inside another packet easily, iff Xi < Xj - and one packet can contain only ONE packet inside it.

So, when Little Kuldeep receives all the packets from Deepu, he decides to reduce the number of total packets for easier smuggling; can you help Little Kuldeep extend his business, by letting him know the minimum number of packets required for him to successfully smuggle the drugs?

## Input format

- The first line contains the number of test cases T.
- Every test case contains a number N, denoting the number of total drug packets.
- This is followed by N lines, containing the highness value of each packet.

## Output format

You've to output the minimum number of packets, optimally putting one inside each other.
