# [Game Of Strengths][link]

Andrew is very fond of Maths.He has N boxes with him,in each box there is some value which represents the Strength of the Box.The ith box has strength A[i]. He wants to calculate the Overall Power of the all N Boxes.

Overall Power here means Sum of Absolute Difference of the strengths of the boxes(between each pair of boxes) multiplied by the Maximum strength among N boxes. Since the Overall Power could be a very large number,output the number modulus 10‚Åπ + 7 (1000000007).

## Input format

- First line of the input contains the number of test cases T.
- It is followed by T test cases. Each test case has 2 lines.
  - First line contains the number of boxes N.
  - It is followed by a line containing N elements where ith element is the strength of Andrew's ith box.

## Output format

For each test case, output a single number, which is the Overall Power for that testcase.
