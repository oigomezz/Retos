# [Different queries][link]

You are given an array A of size N. You have to perform Q queries on the array. Each of these queries belongs to the following types of queries:

1. L R X: Add X to all elements in the range [L,R].
2. L R X: Set the value of all elements in the range [L,R] to X.

However, it is not mandatory to perform the queries in order. Your task is to determine the lexicographically largest array that can be obtained by performing all the Q queries.

## Input format

- First line: Two space-separated integers N and Q.
- Next line: N space-separated integers denoting the array A.
- Next Q lines: The queries to be performed of the type L R X.

## Output format

Print N space-separated integers that denote the lexicographically largest array that can be obtained as mentioned in the problem statement.
