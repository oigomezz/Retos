# [Distinct Arithmetic Sequences][link]

You are given two non-decreasing sequences A = (A1,A2, ..., Am) and B = (B1, B2, ..., Bn).

You can choose any two indices i and j, and then swap Ai and Bj.

Note that the you can do the operations as many times as you want, and your goal is to transform A into an arithmetic sequence. After opeartions, you can rearrange the sequence A.

Now, determine how many distinct arithmetic sequences you can obtain.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
- For each testcase:
  - The first line contains two integer M and N, the lengths of the sequences A and B, respectively.
  - The second line contains M integers A1,A2, ..., Am.
  - The third line contains N integers B1, B2, ..., Bn.

## Output format

For each testcase, output the number of distinct arithmetic sequences you can obtain.
