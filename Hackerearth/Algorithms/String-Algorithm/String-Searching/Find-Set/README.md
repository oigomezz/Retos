You are given a set of N strings. Your task is to determine the minimum possible size of set S (S is a subset of N strings) such that it meets the following conditions:

- All N strings must be covered by set S.
- A string P is said to be covered by the set S if either P exists in S or any substring of P exists in S.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer N.
- Next N lines contains a string P.

## Output format

Print the minimum possible size of set S, which covers all the N strings.
