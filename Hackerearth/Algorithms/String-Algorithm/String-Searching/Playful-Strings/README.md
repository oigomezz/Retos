# [Playful Strings][link]

Given a string S of length N, you have to tell whether it is playful or not. A playful string is one where the distance between any two adjacent character is exactly 1. Consider that the alphabets are arranged in cyclic manner from 'a' to 'z'. Hence, distance between any character 'i' and 'j' will be defined as minimum number of steps it takes 'i' to reach 'j'. Here, character 'i' can start moving clockwise or anti-clockwise in order to reach at position where character 'j' is placed. Your task is simple, where you just need to print "YES" or "NO"(without quotes) depending on whether the given string is playful or not.

## Input format

- First line of the input contains T denoting the number of test cases.
- T lines follow, each having a string S.

## Output format

Print the answer for each testcase in a separate line.
