# [Palindrome Split][link]

You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the maximum number of palindromic subsequences that can be created from the given string. Each palindromic subsequence must have a length greater than 1, and each element of the string can be part of atmost one palindromic subsequence.

We'll call non-empty string S[p1p2...pk] = S[p1]S[p2]...S[pk] (1 <= p1 < p2 ... < pk <= |S|) subsequence of string S = S1S2...S|S|, where |S| is the length of string S.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists the string S.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum number of palindromic subsequences you can create in a separate line.
