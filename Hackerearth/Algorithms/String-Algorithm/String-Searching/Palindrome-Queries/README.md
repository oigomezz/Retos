# [Palindrome queries][link]

You are given a string S that contains N lowercase alphabets. There are Q queries of the form [L,R]. Your task is to determine if every character in the range [L,R] can be arranged in such a manner that a palindromic substring for that range can be formed. If it is possible to create the palindrome substring in the provided interval, then print Possible. Otherwise, print Impossible.

**Note:** The original string is not changed in the process.

## Input format

- First line: Q denotes the number of queries.
- Second lines: String S of N lowercase English letters.
- Third line: Number of queries of the [L,R] format.

## Output format

Print Q lines for each query. Print Possible if a palindrome substring is formed in the provided interval. Otherwise, print Impossible.
