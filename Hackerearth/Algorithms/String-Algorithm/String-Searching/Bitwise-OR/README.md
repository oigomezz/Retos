# [Bitwise OR][link]

You are given an array A of length N and an integer X. You are required to find all the subarrays of minimum length with BITWISE OR greater than or equal to X.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains N and X.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers each representing elements of array A.

## Output format

- For each test case:
  - In the first line, print count of such subarrays (let it be C). In the next C lines, print all the subarrays (in sorted order).

**Note:** A subarray can be defined by 2 indexes L and R where L and R are starting and ending indexes of that subarray.
