# [Divide Array][link]

Given an array A of size N. Given Q operations, each operation contains an integer D. In each operation you have to divide all the elements of the array by D.

For example, for each operation with a given D, the new array A would be:

A[0] / D, A[1] / D, A[2] / D, ..... , A[N-1] / D

Finally, after processing all the operations you have to print the final array after Q operations.

**Note:** The result of the each division will be an integer, for example 5 / 2 = 2

## Input format

- First line of input contains a single integer N denoting number of elements in the array A.
- Next line of input contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A.
- Next line contains Q denoting number of operations.
- Next Q lines contains a single integer D by which divide the elements of the array.

## Output format

Print single line containing N space separated integers after processing Q operations.
