# [Nobita and String][link]

Doraemon gave Nobita a gadget that swaps words inside a string in the following manner :

If there are W words, word 1 is swapped with word W, word 2 is swapped with word W-1 and so on. The problem is that Nobita himself cannot verify the answer for large strings. Help him write a program to do so.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing the string.

## Output format

Output the string with the words swapped as stated above.
