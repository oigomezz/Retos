# [Good Subsequences][link]

You are given a string S consisting of lowercase alphabets. A good subsequence of this string is a subsequence which contains distinct characters only.

Determine the number of good subsequences of the maximum possible length modulo 10⁹ + 7.

In other words, determine the length X of the longest good subsequence and the number of good subsequences of length X modulo 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- First line: An integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each of the next T lines: String S.

## Output format

For each test case, print the number of good subsequences of the maximum length modulo 10⁹ + 7.

Answer for each test case should come in a new line.
