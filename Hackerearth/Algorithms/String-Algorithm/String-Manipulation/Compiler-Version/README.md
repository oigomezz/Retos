# [Compiler Version][link]

You are converting an old code for a new version of the compiler.

In the old code we have used "->" for pointers. But now we have to replace each "->" with a ".". But this replacement shouldn't be done inside commments. A comment is a string that starts with "//" and terminates at the end of the line.

## Input format

- At max. 2000 lines of code.
- Each line of code consists of at maximum 60 characters.

## Output format

New code with required changes.
