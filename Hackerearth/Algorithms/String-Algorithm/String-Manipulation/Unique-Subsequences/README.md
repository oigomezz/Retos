# [Unique subsequences][link]

You are given a string S that contains N characters. Your task is to determine the maximum possible size of the subsequence T of S such that no two adjacent characters in T are the same.

**Note:** The string contains only lowercase English alphabets.

## Input format

- First line: A single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - First line: Single integer N denoting the size of the string.
  - Second line: S denoting the string.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer that represents the maximum size of the subsequence that satisfies the provided condition.
