# [Sorted String][link]

Little Ashish got a lot of strings as his birthday gift. He does not mind getting so many strings for free; in fact, he loves them. But, on noticing all the strings he received as a gift, Little Ashish, who's also a snob and a bit OCD kind of a guy, realizes that he does not like the way in which the strings are arranged.

He likes his strings sorted, in a different kind of a way. He wants his strings to be sorted based on the count of characters present in the string. For instance, if the string is: "aaabbc", then the desired string would be: cbbaaa. In case where the count of two characters is same, then the lexicographically smaller one will be printed first. For instance: "aabbcc" then, the output will be: "aabbcc".

## Input format

First line of input contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains a single string S.

## Output format

For each test cases print the sorted string.
