# [Mirror of Mahatma Gandhi][link]

On the way to Dandi March, Gandhijee carried a mirror with himself.

When he reached Dandi, he decided to play a game with the tired people to give them some strength.

At each turn of the game he pointed out a person and told him to say a number N(possibly huge) of his choice.

The number was called lucky if that equals it's mirror image.

## Input format

- First line contains number of test cases T.
- Each test case contains a single integer N.

## Output format

For each test case print "YES" if the number was lucky else print "NO" (quotes for clarity) in one line.
