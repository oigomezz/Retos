# [Swapping Game][link]

Sherlock and Watson are playing swapping game. Watson gives to Sherlock a string S on which he has performed K swaps. You need to help Sherlock in finding the original string.
One swap on a string is performed in this way:

- Assuming 1 indexing, the i'th letter from the end is inserted between i'th and (i+1)'th letter from the starting.

For example, we have "contest". After one swap, it would change to "ctosnet".

## Input format

- First line contains K, the number of swaps performed by Watson.
- Next line contains S, the string Watson gives to Sherlock.

## Output format

You have to print in one line the original string with which Watson had started.
