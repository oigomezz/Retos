# [Make Palindrome][link]

There is a string that consists of lowercase english alphabets and we have to make the string a palindrome
For this, we have 2 types of operations

1. Re-arrange the string however you want (this operation is free)
2. Add a new character to the end of the string (this operation will cost 1Re)

Your task is to calculate the minimum amount of money to make the string a palindrome

## Input format

- The first line contains one integer T the number of test cases.
- The first line of every test case consists of N, the length of the string.
- The second line of every test case contains string S.

## Output format

For every test case output one integer, the minimum amount of money required to make the string a palindrome
