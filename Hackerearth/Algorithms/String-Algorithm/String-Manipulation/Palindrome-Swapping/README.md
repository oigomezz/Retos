# [Palindrome Swapping][link]

There are given two strings S and T consisting of lowercase English letters, both of same length. Let’s say length of both strings is N.

Is it possible to make both strings equal by doing following changes any number of times:

- Choose any index i (0 <= i < N) and swap S[i] and T[i].
- Choose any index i (0 <= i < N) and swap S[i] and S[n - i - 1]
- Choose any index i (0 <= i < N) and swap T[i] and T[n - i - 1]

## Input format

- First line contains a String S.
- Second line contains a String T.

## Output format

Print “YES” (without quotes) if you can make S and T equal. Else print “NO” (without quotes) .
