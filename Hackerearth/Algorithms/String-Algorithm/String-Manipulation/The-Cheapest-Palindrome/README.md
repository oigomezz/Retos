# [The Cheapest Palindrome][link]

Palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam.

You are given a string whose length is even, and each character of the string is either 'a', 'b' or '/' Your task is to replace each occurrence of '/' in string with either 'a' or 'b' such that the string becomes a palindrome.

You are also given two integers, aCost and bCost. Replacing '/' with 'a' costs aCost, and replacing '/' with 'b' costs bCost.

Return the minimum cost of replacing '/' by 'a' and 'b' such that the string turns into a palindrome. If it is impossible to obtain a palindrome, return -1.

## Input format

- First line of input will contain the number of test cases.
- For each test case, there will be of three lines:
  - The first line is the string whose palindrome is to be constructed.
  - The second is the aCost.
  - The third is the bCost.
