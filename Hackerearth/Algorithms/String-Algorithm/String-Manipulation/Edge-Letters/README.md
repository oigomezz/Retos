# [Edge Letters][link]

You are given a string S of length N consisting of lowercase english alphabets and you are required to process Q queries. Each query is of the form (ai,bi), where ai and bi are characters from the english lowercase alphabet. You should print the number of substrings of S, whose first character is ai and last character is bi.

A substring is obtained by removing a prefix and a suffix of the string. Two substrings si1 ... sj1 and si2 ... sj2 are different if the ordered pair (i1,j1) is different from (i2,j2).

## Input format

- The first line contains the string S.
- The second line contains the integer Q, the number of queries.
- Each of the next Q lines contains two characters ai and bi, separated by a space.

## Output format

For each query, output the number of substrings of S, whose first character is ai and last character is bi.
