# [Compatibility Queries][link]

Any integer A is said to be compatible with another integer B if A|B = A + B where A|B is the Bitwise OR of A and B.

You are given an array A of N integers. You are also given Q queries where each query has a single integer X. For each query find the sum of all the array elements which are compatible with X.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer N.
- The second line, contains N space-separated integers, the array elements.
- The third line contains a single integer Q.
- The next Q lines contain a single integer each, the value of X.

## Output format

Print the answer for each query in a separate line â€” the sum of all the array elements which are compatible with X.
