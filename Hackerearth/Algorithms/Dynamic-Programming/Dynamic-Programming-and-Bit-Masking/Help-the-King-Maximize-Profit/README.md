# [Help the King Maximize Profit][link]

A king possesses vacant houses within his town, arranged in an N\*M matrix. Each house is currently unoccupied. Within the town, there are introverted and extroverted individuals seeking residence.

When the king allocates a house to an introvert, he gains 360 rupees; if given to an extrovert, he gains 120 rupees.

However, for each person residing near an introvert, the king incurs a loss of 90 rupees, whereas for each person near an extrovert, he gains 60 rupees.

The objective is to determine the maximum profit achievable by the king. The allocation of accommodation to all individuals is not mandatory; the primary goal is to optimize the king's profit.

A person is called residing near another person if they live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

## Input format

- The one and only line contains 4 integers N, M, X (no of introverts) and Y (no of extroverts).

## Output format

Print one integer - the maximum profit achievable by the king
