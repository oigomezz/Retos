# [Xenny and Random Cubes][link]

Xenny had N cubes. Each cube had six faces and each face had a Latin character on each of it's sides. Xenny's friend Asdoc had an interesting activity in mind. He gave Xenny a string S and asked him to use the cubes to form that string. Xenny being a very lazy person, just wanted to randomly roll the cubes and then arrange a subset of them, to form the string S. Xenny relied on probability to get the desired string from the characters on the cubes.

Given the character on each face of each of the cubes, find out the the number of ways in which Xenny is able to make string S using the upward facing characters.

## Input format

- The first line of input consists of 2 space-separated integers - N and K - the number of cubes and the length of string S respectively.
- N lines follow. Each line contains 6 space-separated characters, with ith line representing the characters on the 6 faces of the ith cube.
- Last line of input contains string S.

## Output format

Output the required number of ways MOD 10‚Åπ + 7.
