# [Expectation][link]

Y was looking for a single sign of hope and then he saw a grid with two rows and n columns. as a typical prison punishment Y is going to paint the grid.

Y thinks two cells are connected if they share a side and both are painted in the same color.

He also thinks there is a path between two cells A and B if there is a sequence of cells which starts with A and ends with B and any two consecutive cells in the sequence are connected.

Y calls a subset of grid's cells a connected component, if there is a path between any pair of subset's cells.

And at last, Y calls a connected component C a maximal connected component, if there isn't any other connected component that includes C.

If Y paints a cell in black or white with the same probability (both 1/2), what is the expected number of maximal connected components modular 10⁹ + 7 in the colored grid?

If the expected value is P/Q, print P \* Q⁻¹ mod 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- First and the only input line contains only n, number of grid's columns.

## Output format

The only line of output contains an integer, expected number of maximal connected components modular 10⁹ + 7.
