# [Integer distribution][link]

You are given a list A of N integers. Here, N is an even number. These integers must be distributed into N/2 pairs and the power of each of the pairs is added.

The power of a pair P(i,j) consisting of the i-th and j-th number is defined as the XOR of the two numbers A[i] and A[j].

Write a program to determine the minimum and the maximum possible sum of the N/2 pairs.

## Input format

- First line: An integer N.
- Next N lines: An integer where each denotes an element of the list.

## Output format

The output consists of two space-separated integers. The first is the minimum possible sum and the second is the maximum possible sum.
