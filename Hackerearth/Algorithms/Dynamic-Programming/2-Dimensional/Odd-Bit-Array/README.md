# [Odd Bit Array][link]

You are given an array A of N integers. A partitioning of the array A is the splitting of A into one or more non-empty contiguous subarrays such that each element of A belongs to exactly one of these subarrays.

Find the number of ways to partition A such that the Bitwise XOR of elements within each subarray has an odd number of set bits (i.e., 1s). Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].

## Output format

For each test case, print the answer in a separate line.
