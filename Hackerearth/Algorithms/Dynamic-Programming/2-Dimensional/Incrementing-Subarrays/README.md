# [Incrementing Subarrays][link]

You are given an array A of length N. You are also given an integer, K. You can increment all elements of any subarray of A by K, at most once.

Let us define the score of A as the sum of A[i] % A[i-1], for all i in the range [1, N-1] . Find the maximum possible score you can obtain.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains a single integer T, which denotes the number of test cases.
- The first line of each testcase contains two integers, N and K, denoting the length of the array A, and the increment amount respectively.
- The second line of each testcase contains N integers, denoting the array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum possible score you can obtain.
