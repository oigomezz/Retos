# [Arrays and sums][link]

You are given an array of elements A1,A2,...,An. If you are considering index i, then you contain a set S of all elements whose index is not equal to i. Your task is to find out if you can express Ai as the sum of subsets of S.

Note that you can select no more times than it occurs in set S.

You are given array A. For every index, your task is to determine if it is possible for index i from 1 to N.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,...,An.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single line consisting of N space-separated integers (0 or 1). Print 0 if it is not possible and 1 if it is possible.
