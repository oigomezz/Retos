# [Count the permutation][link]

You are given two numbers, namely A and S.

Write a program to find the number of ways in which the numbers that are greater than or equal to S can be added to get the sum A. Print the result as modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.

## Input format

- First line: T (Number of test cases).
- First line in each test case: Two space-separated integers A and S.

## Output format

For each test case, print the number of ways to acquire the sum A using the numbers that are greater than or equal to S.
