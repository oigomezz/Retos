# [Cheapest items][link]

You are given N items with their price (Pi) and value (Vi).

You are required to choose a subset of items such that (size of subset + sum of values of all selected elements) >= N and the sum of prices of all selected elements must be minimum.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of N items.
- Each of the next N lines contain two space-separated integers Vi and Pi.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single line denoting the minimum value of the sum of prices of selected elements.
