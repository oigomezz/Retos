# [Odd subsequences][link]

You are given an array A consisting of N elements. Find the number of subsequences of length K with odd sum modulo 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line contains the number of test cases T.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers N denoting the number of elements in array A and K denoting the length of subsequence.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers of array A.

## Output format

Print T lines. For each test case:

- Print a single integer denoting the number of subsequences of length K with odd sum modulo 10⁹ + 7.
