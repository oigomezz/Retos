# [Array conversion][link]

You are given an array Arr containing N numbers and an integer K. You can implement the following operations on this array:

- Replace an element Arr[i] with -Arr[i]
- Replace an element Arr[i] with Arr[i] + i
- Replace an element Arr[i] with Arr[i] - i

You cannot perform more than one operation per element of the array.

Write a program to determine whether it is possible to make the sum of all the elements in the array Arr equal to K.

## Input format

- First line: T (number of test cases)
- First line in each test case: Two space-separated integers N and K
- Second line in each test case: N space-separated integers (denoting the array )

## Output format

For each test case, print YES or NO depending on the result.
