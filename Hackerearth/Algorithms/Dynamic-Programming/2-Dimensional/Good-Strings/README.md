# [Good strings][link]

Given a string S of length N consisting of only lower case alphabets. Print the total count of good strings. A string is called good if:

- its length is N and consists of only lower case alphabets.
- it mismatches with S at exactly K different indexes.
- it is lexicographically smaller than S.

Since the answer could be large print it with modulo 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains integers N and K, denoting the size of the length of the S and mismatch count.
- The next line contains S.

## Output format

Print the number of total possible good strings. Since the answer could be large print it with modulo 10⁹ + 7.
