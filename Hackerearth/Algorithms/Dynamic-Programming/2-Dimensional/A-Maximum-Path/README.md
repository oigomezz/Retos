You are given an undirected tree T with N nodes rooted at node 1. Every node is assigned a value denoted by A[i].

You are given Q queries of type:

- u v: Print the maximum value of the node present on a simple path between node u and v.

## Input format

- The first line contains two space-separated integers N Q denoting the number of nodes and queries respectively.
- Next line contains space-separated integers denoting array A.
- Next N - 1 lines contain two space-separated integers a b denoting an edge between node a and b.
- Next Q lines contain two space-separated integers u v denoting the query.

## Output format

For each query, print the required answer in a new line.
