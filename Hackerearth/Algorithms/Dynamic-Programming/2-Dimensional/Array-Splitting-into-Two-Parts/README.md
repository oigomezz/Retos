# [Array Splitting into two parts (P2SME)][link]

You are given an array of size N. Distribute the elements of the array into two parts such that the product of the sum of two parts is maximum.

In other words,

- Let f(x) denote sum of the elements in Part1.
- Let g(x) denote sum of the elements in Part2.

You need to maximise f(x) \* g(x).

## Input format

- First line contains an integer N, denoting number of elements in array.
- Next line contains N integers denoting the array elements.

## Output format

Maximum value of f(x) \* g(x).
