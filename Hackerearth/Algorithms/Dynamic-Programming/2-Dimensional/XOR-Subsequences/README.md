# [Xor Subsequences][link]

Given an array A of length N. For every index i, find the number of distinct non-empty XOR subsequences in the subarray A[1,2,...,i].

Note:

- 1 based indexing is used.
- Two subsequences are said to be distinct if the XOR of the elements present in the subsequences is different.
- A subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Input format

- First line contains an integer N.
- Next line contains N space-separated integers denoting the array A.

## Output format

Print N space-separated integers where i-th integer denoting the number of distinct XOR subsequences of subarray A[1,2,...,i].
