# [Longest special subsequences][link]

You are given a string S of the length n consisting of only lowercase English alphabets.

If the two consecutive characters in a subsequence have a difference that is no more than k, then it is called a special subsequence. Find the length of the longest special subsequence.

## Input format

- First line: t (number of test cases).
- Next t line: Three space-separated integers n, k, and S.

## Output format

For each test case, print the length of the longest special subsequence in a new line.
