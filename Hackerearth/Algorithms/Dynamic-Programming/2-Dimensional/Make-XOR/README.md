# [Make Xor][link]

Bob was experimenting with an array of numbers in an effort to make a programming problem, finally he made an interesting problem but he cannot solve it, can you help Bob?

Given an array A of n integers, Bob wants you to answer q different queries based on the given array. For each query Bob wants to know the minimum number of values he should remove from the array A to make the XOR of the remaining values in the array equal to x.

NOTE: The XOR of an empty array is 0.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains an integer n, the number of values in the array.
- The second line of the input contains n integers, the values in the array.
- The third line of the input contains an integer q, the number of queries.
- Each of the next q lines contains one integer, the queried value.

## Output format

Print q integers. The i-th integer should represent the minimum number of values to remove from A to make the XOR equal to xi, or -1 if it is impossible.
