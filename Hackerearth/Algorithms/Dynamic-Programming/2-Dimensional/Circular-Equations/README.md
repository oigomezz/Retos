# [Circular equations][link]

You are given S. Determine the number of possible values of N that satisfy the following condition:

- You are given N where represents a number that is generated by shifting the digits of N cyclically towards left by i units.

Also, N must satisfy the provided condition:

- S is the summation {F(N,i)} for all i from 0 to |N| - 1 where |N| represents the number of digits in N.

N can have leading zeroes. As the number of N can be very large, print it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.
- The next Q lines contain an integer S.

## Output format

Print a single integer in a separate line corresponding to each query.
