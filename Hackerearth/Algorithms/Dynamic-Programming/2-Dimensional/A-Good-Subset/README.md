# [A good subset][link]

You are given an array A that consists of N positive integers. A subset of the array A is good when the sum of the elements of the subset is K or greater.

An element of the array is unnecessary if for any good subset of the array containing i element, the set that can be obtained by eliminating i from the subset is also good.

Find the number of the unnecessary elements present in array A.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
- The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers denoting array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the total number of unneccessary elements present in the array in a new line.
