# [Scoring stores][link]

A, B, and C are three friends. Their birth dates are in the ratio of 1:2:4. B forms a quadratic equation of the form axÂ² + bx + c, where the coefficient a, b and c are the birth date ratios, that is, a=1, b=2, and c=4.

C is preparing for a test, he gives n online tests and stores the score of these n tests in the form of an array. C wants to arrange the scores of these n tests in a non-decreasing order such that he can show it to his friends about his improvement. He uses the following operation to perform this task:

- Select one of the test marks and multiply it with the root of the quadratic equation provided by B.

Determine the minimum number of operations required to perform the task.

## Input format

- First line: n denoting the number of test cases.
- Second line: n integers denoting the marks obtained in each test.

## Output format

Print a single integer that represents the minimum number of operations that can be performed to complete the task. If it is not possible, then print -1.
