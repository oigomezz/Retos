# [Palindromes Everywhere][link]

You are given 2 strings A and B.

Let F(S) denote a substring of S, possibly empty.

Let W = F(A) + F(B), ("+" = concatenation)

Find the maximum possible length of such a string W which is also a Palindrome.

## Input format

- First Line contains the string A.
- Second Line contains the string B.

## Output format

Print the maximum possible length of a palindromic string W.
