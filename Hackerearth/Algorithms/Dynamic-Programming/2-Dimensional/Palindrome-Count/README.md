# [Palindrome Count][link]

Given a string S, count the number of non empty sub strings that are palindromes.

A sub string is any continuous sequence of characters in the string.

A string is said to be palindrome, if the reverse of the string is same as itself.

Two sub strings are different if they occur at different positions in S

## Input format

- Input contains only a single line that contains string S.

## Output format

Print a single number, the number of sub strings that are palindromes.
