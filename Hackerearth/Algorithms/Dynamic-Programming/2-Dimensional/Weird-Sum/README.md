# [Weird Sum][link]

We are given N numbers. We have to select K of them. We also have a number M. Suppose the numbers we selected were A1,A2,...,Ak. (note that we write these numbers in order in which they appeared in the original array). Define S = Î£ Ai \* (i mod M).

We have to maximize S.

## Input format

- In the first line, three space separated integers N,K,M are given.
- In the next line, N space separated integers A1,A2,...,An are given.

## Output format

Print a single integer corresponding to the answer.
