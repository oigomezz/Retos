# [String Transformation][link]

It is known that the string s contains only lowercase English characters. Also, the string t contains lowercase English characters and digit characters. You can replace each digit character of t by a substring consisting of lowercase English characters. Note that the length of such a substring should be not greater than the digit value.

For example, if string t = “a22fg”, then you can replace the two “2”’s by “bc” and “de”, respectively. So t can be transformed into “abcdefg”.

Determine if the string t can be transformed into the string s or not.

**Note:** The lengths of the string s and t are n and m, respectively.

## Input format

- The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
- For each testcase:
  - The first line contains two integers n,m, the lengths of s and t, respectively.
  - The second line contains a string s of length n.
  - The third line contains a string t of length m.

## Output format

For each Testcase, output "YES" if the string t can be transformed into the string s. Otherwise, output "NO".
