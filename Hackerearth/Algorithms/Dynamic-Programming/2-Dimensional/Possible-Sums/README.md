# [Possible Sums][link]

Given an array A of N elements, find the number of distinct possible sums that can be obtained by taking any number of elements from the array and adding them.

Note that 0 can always be obtained by taking none.

## Input format

- First line of the input contains number of test cases T.
- Each test case has two lines:
  - First line has N, the number of elements in the array followed by N values which are elements of the array.

## Output format

For each test case, print a single line, the distinct possible sums that can be obtained.
