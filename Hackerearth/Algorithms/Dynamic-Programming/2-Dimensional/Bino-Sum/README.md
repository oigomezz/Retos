# [Bino-Sum][link]

Let us define F(N,K) be number of subsets of K distinct elements of S where N is the size of S. Given a P (<= N), let sum = F(N,0) + F(N,1) + F(N,2) + ... + F(N,P).

You have to print sum modulo 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- First line contains, T, the number of testcases.
- Each testcase consists of N and P in one line.

## Output format

Print required answer in one line for each testcase.
