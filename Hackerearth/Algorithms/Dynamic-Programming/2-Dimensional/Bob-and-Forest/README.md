# [Bob and Forest][link]

You are given a 2D character array denoting forest of length N and breadth M . In the matrix, '.' denotes barren land and ' \* ' denotes tree.

You are given Q questions. In each question, you are given integer K and you have to determine the number of unique squares of side less than or equal to K which contain only trees.

## Input format

- First line : N and M (N denoting number of rows and M denoting number of columns).
- Each of the next N lines contains string of M length containing '.' and '\*' .
- Next line consists of an integer Q, denoting number of questions.
- Each of the next Q lines contains a single integer K.

## Output format

For each question, print the number of unique squares of side less than or equal to K which contain only trees. Answer for each question should come in a new line.
