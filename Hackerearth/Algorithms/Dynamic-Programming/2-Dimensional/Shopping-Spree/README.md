# [Shopping Spree!][link]

Today, Vasya has decided to go to the Shopping Centre to buy some stuff for the upcoming College Farewell. On reaching the place, he found a fascinating shop that has an unlimited quantity of each item they sell. The shop has N different types of items. However, here Vasya has a fixed budget and can buy a maximum of K items. He can buy any amount of items >= 1 and <= K.

He can buy an arbitrary quantity of each item. There is no restriction on different items having different quantities. Now, Vasya wonders the number of different ways in which he can shop today. Two ways are considered different if the quantity of at least 1 of the items purchased is different. Vasya finds this task too hard to complete and requires your help.
