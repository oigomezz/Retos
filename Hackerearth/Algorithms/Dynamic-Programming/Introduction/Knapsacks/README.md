# [Knapsacks][link]

You are given n objects, a knapsack of capacity c, array v, and array w. The i-th object has value v[i] and weight w[i].

Determine the maximum total value that you can get by selecting objects in such a manner that their sum of weights is not greater than the capacity c.

## Input format

- First line: Two integers n and c denoting the number of objects and capacity of the knapsack.
- Second line: n integers (array v)
- Third line: n integers (array w)

## Output format

Print a single integer denoting the maximum value that you can get by selecting the objects.
