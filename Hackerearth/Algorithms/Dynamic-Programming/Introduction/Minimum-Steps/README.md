# [Minimum steps][link]

You are given an array Arr that contains N integers. In one step, you can pick an element from position p and place it before or after some other elements. For example, if you are given an array Arr[] ={1,3,2}, then you can pick 3 and place it after 2. Therefore, the updated array is Arr[] ={1,2,3}.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of steps that is required to sort the data in increasing or decreasing order.

## Input format

- First line: A single integer N denoting the size of array Arr.
- Second line: N space-separated integers, where the i-th integer denotes Arr[i].

## Output format

Print a single integer value that denotes the minimum number of steps that is required to sort the data in increasing or decreasing order.
