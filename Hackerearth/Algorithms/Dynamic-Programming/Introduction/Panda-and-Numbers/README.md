# [Panda and Numbers][link]

Panda is fond of numbers. Given a number, he subtracts it with squares of any one particular digit of that number to get new numbers. This operation can be applied any number of times (possibly zero) till he obtains a pandatic number. If he is able to reach to a pandatic number then he wins. A pandatic number is a number which can be expressed in the form A^A, where A is a positive integer.

## Input format

- The first line will contain T, the number of test cases.
- Then T lines follow, each containing an integer N.

## Output format

For each test case, output whether it's possible for panda to reach a pandatic number by doing the operations as described. If it's possible print "Yes" (without quotes), otherwise print "No" (without quotes).
