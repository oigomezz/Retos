# [Beautiful Sequence][link]

A sequence of integers is called a beautiful sequence if all the integers in it are positive and it is a strictly increasing sequence.

Given a sequence of integers, you have to make it a beautiful sequence. For that you can change any element you want, but you should make as less changes as possible in order to make it a beautiful sequence.

## Input format

- The first line of input is an integer T(T <= 5), the number of test cases. Each test case contains 2 lines.
- The first line of the test case contains an integer (0 < N <= 100000), i.e. the number of elements in the original sequence.
- The second line contains N positive integers, no larger than 2000000000, which forms the original sequence.

## Output format

For each test case output the minimal number of elements you must change in the original sequence to make it a beautiful sequence.
