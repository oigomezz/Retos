# [Accommodation][link]

There is a hotel with M floors. i-th floor of the hotel has infinite identical rooms, each room can accommodate C[i] people (Two rooms of same floor are indifferentiable and have same capacity while two rooms of different floors have different capacity).

There is one rule: Any room on i-th floor will accommodate exactly C[i] people (not less or more).

Now N identical people come for accommodation. You can assign any of them to any room of any floor following the mentioned rule.

Way of assigning: If we have 5 people and 3 floors. Let's say floor 1 has room capacity 1 and floor 2 has room capacity 2, then: (1,2,2) is a way of assigning people. This means we assign one person out of those 5 people to any room of floor 1. The remaining 4 people are assigned to two rooms of floor 2, each room accommodating 2 people. We will consider (1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,1) as the same ways as we can't differentiate between them.

You have to tell number of different ways of accommodating N people.

Two ways are considered different if one way is not a permutation of other way.

## Input format

- First line consists of two integers M and N, denoting number of floors and number of people respectively.
- Second line consists of M space separated integers denoting capacity of floors. i-th integer denotes capacity of i-th floor.

## Output format

Print the number of different ways of accommodating people. Since the number of ways can be large, print the answer modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.
