# [Palindromic game][link]

Alice and Bob are playing a game with a string of English alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase). They can select a character either from the start or end of the string. Put the selected character in a common box. The winner of the game is the first person who can make a string palindrome of length greater than 1 by using some of the box's characters. Alice starts first to pick a character and both players play optimally. Determine the winner of the game or depict if it is a Tie.

**Note:** A tie occurs when no one wins.

## Input format

The only line contains a string S of n lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## Output format

If Alice wins the game, then print Alice. If Bob wins the game, then print Bob. If no one wins the game, then print Tie.
