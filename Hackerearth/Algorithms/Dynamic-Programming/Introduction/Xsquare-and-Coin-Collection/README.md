# [Xsquare And Coin Collection][link]

Xsquare loves to play with the coins very much. Today, he has N stacks of coins. Each stack of coins has some non zero height Hi equal to the number of coins on that stack (considering all the coins are identical and each coin has a height of 1 unit).

In one move, Xsquare can select any number of consecutive stacks of coins such that the height of each selected stack of coins Hi â‰¤ K. Once such a sequence of stacks is chosen, Xsquare can collect any number of coins from the chosen sequence of stacks.

Xsquare wonders what is the maximum number of coins that he can collect this way?

## Input format

- First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- First line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K where N being the number of stacks of coins.
- Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the number of coins Hi on each stack.

## Output format

For each test case, Print the maximum number of coins Xsquare can collect following the above gaming strategy.
