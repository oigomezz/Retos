# [Tower of Hanoi][link]

Bob and Alice like to play the game tower of Hanoi. One day Alice challenges Bob to build the tallest tower from a set of disks of different height and radius. The tower of Hanoi can be built by stacking disks on top of each other. In order to put disk A on top of disk B, the radius and height of A must be strictly smaller than those of B. Help Bob to win the challenge.

## Input format

- First line of input contains number of test cases T.
  - First line of each test case contains value of N, the number of disks.
  - The next N lines contains two positive integer number Ri and Hi corresponding to the radius and height of ith Disk respectively.

## Output format

For each test case print the maximum height of the tower possible.
