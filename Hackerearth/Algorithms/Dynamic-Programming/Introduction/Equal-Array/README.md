# [Equal Array][link]

You are given an array A of size N.

Find the minimum non negative number X such that there exist an index j and when you can replace Aj by Aj + X, the sum of elements of array from index 1 to j and j+1 to N becomes equal, where 1 <= j <= N-1. Assume array to be 1-indexed.

If there is no possible X print -1 in separate line.

## Input format

- The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
- For each Test case:
  - The first line contains an integer N, size of the array.
  - The second line contains N space-separated integers, the i-th of which is A[i].

## Output format

For each test case, print the required answer in separate line.
