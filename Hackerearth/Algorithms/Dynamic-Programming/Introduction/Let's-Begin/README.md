February Easy Challenge 2015 is underway. Hackerearth welcomes you all and hope that all you awesome coders have a great time. So without wasting much of the time let's begin the contest.

Prime Numbers have always been one of the favourite topics for problem setters.

Aishwarya is a mathematics student at the Department of Mathematics and Computing, California. Her teacher recently gave her an intriguing assignment with only a single question. The question was to find out the minimum number of single digit prime numbers which when summed equals a given number X.

## Input format

- The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases.
- Each of the next T lines contains a single integer X.

## Output format

Print the minimum number required. If it is not possible to obtain X using single digit prime numbers, output -1.
