# [Pankaj and his in-laws!][link]

Pankaj is a very intelligent student studying in one of the best colleges of this country. He's good enough to challenge the smartest minds in the country, but even the smart ones make mistakes and so did Pankaj - he fell in love, ah. He was so deeply in love that he decided to propose the love of his life. What he didn't know was the fact that there is a different species called the "in-laws" and against them no amount of intelligence, smartness or anything works!

But, this was no ordinary person - this was Pankaj - he decided to take the challenge of his in-laws. So, in order to verify the compatibility of the two love birds, they gave them a sequence to solve - given a sequence, they had to tell the longest increasing subsequence of the given sequence.

But, this was a tricky game - since, any sequence could have multiple increasing subsequences of the same length - so, the answer they were giving were different almost all the time, which got the young couple worried.

So, in order increase their compatibility Pankaj proposes that instead of telling them the sequence, this time the couple would tell them the length of the longest increasing subsequence and not the sequence.

To give further twist by the in-laws, they asked Pankaj to answer the length not in decimal numbers, but in binary numbers!

## Input format

- In the first line, a number t which will indicate the number of numbers in the sequence given to Pankaj by his in-laws.
- Then, in the next line, t integers denoting the numbers in the sequence.

## Output format

Print the length of the longest increasing subsequence in binary numbers.
