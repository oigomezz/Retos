# [Prime Numbers Again][link]

Panda can do any problem anytime and anywhere. Panda is doing an extensive research on prime numbers. Milinda has got a question for Panda. The only way for Panda to impress Milinda is by solving this question.

Given a number N, find the minimum number of primatic numbers which sum upto N.

A primatic number refers to a number which is either a prime number or can be expressed as power of prime number to itself i.e. prime^(prime) e.g. 4, 27, etc.

**Note:** 8, 32, etc are not primatic numbers.

Panda is very sad since he is unable to solve the problem. Please help Panda in solving this problem.
