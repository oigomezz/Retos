# [Counting Number of Ways][link]

HP is standing at a distance of X kilometres from her house . She can travel at most K kilometres in a single step. She wants to know total number of ways to reach her house . As the number of ways can be large , print it modulo 10⁹ + 7.

**Note:** She can't take step of 0 kilometres, i.e., step should be positive integer.

## Input format

- First line contains one integers T denoting number of test cases .
- Each of the next T lines contains two integers X and K.

## Output format

For each test case, print the number of ways modulo 10⁹ + 7. Answer for each test case should come in a new line.
