# [Moody Numbers][link]

Some people are just moody, you just cannot reason with them. Same goes with Natural Numbers. Some of them ultimely want to become 1 or 4 and will evolve infinite times if they have to, to become what they want to. To evolve, they use a function F such that N = F(N). Function F(N) is defined as :

- F(N) = sum_of_digits(N 2)

So, your task is that given a number N, output if it is possible for it to ultimately become {1 or 4} or not.

## Input format

- First line contains T which is the number of test cases.
- T lines follow each with an integer N.

## Output format

For each N output "YES" or "NO" if the number can achieve desired goal or not.
