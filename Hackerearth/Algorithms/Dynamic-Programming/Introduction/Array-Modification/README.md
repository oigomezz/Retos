# [Array modification][link]

M as a prisoner loves playing with his array a1,a2,...,an, he can do following operation as much as he wants:

- Choose two integers i,j that 1 <= i,j <= n and |i-j| = 1 and also ai >= 2.
- Then add 1 to aj (aj = aj +1) and subtract 2 from ai (ai = ai - 2).

M thinks beautifulness of an array is maximum value of it (max(a1,a2,...,an)).

What is the maximum value of beautifulness that M can get after doing above operation as much as he wants?

## Input format

- First line contains only n, length of array.
- Second line contains the array elements a1,a2,...,an separated by space.

## Output format

The only line of output contains an integer, maximum beautifulness value that M can get.
