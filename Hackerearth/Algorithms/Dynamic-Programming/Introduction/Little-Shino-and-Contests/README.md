# [Little Shino and Contests][link]

Given two array A and B of length 5. You have 5 problems to solve in a contest. For i-th problem you need exactly A[i] minutes to solve. But you can't concentrate on i-th problem for more than B[i] minutes continuously. Find number of ways to schedule the Σ A[i] minutes so that you will solve all the 5 problems (mod 10⁹ + 7)? Scheduling means for each minute, you have to decide on which problem you will concentrate during that minute.

Two schedules are considered different if at-least for one of the Σ A[i] minutes, you are concentrating on different problems in both the schedules.

## Input format

- First line contains 5 space separated integers, denoting A.
- Second line contains 5 space separated integers, denoting B.

## Output format

Find number of ways to schedule the Σ A[i] minutes so that you will solve all the 5 problems (mod 10⁹ + 7)
