In code world all genders are considered equal ( It means their is nothing like male or female). Now their are N distinct persons living in this hypothetical world. Each person can pair up with any other person or can even remain single.

One day Vbhu planned to visit code world. Being a maths guy , he always try to be mathematical. So he started counting the ways in which N persons living in code world can make pairs or remain single. A single person can make pair with at most one other person.

Seeing that N can be large , Vibhu ask you for help. Now being a great programmer you need to help Vbhu count the number of ways in which N persons living in code world can make pairs or remain single.

**Note:** Its not necessary that everyone is required to make pair with someone. Person can remain single also.

## Input format

- First line contain number of test cases T.
- Then next T lines contain a single integer N, denoting the number of persons living in code world.

## Output format

You need to print the number of ways in which N different persons can make their pairs or stay single. As answer can be large so print it modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.
