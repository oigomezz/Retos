# [A matrix and XOR operation][link]

You are given an N\*M matrix S consisting of all 0's at the beginning. You can perform the following operations any number of times:

1. You can perform the XOR operation on all the elements of a row by 1.
2. You can perform the XOR operation on all the elements of a column by 1.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to get ΣΣ Sij = K by using the provided operations.

## Input format

- The first line consists of T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M, and K.

## Output format

For each test case, print "Yes" if it is possible to get this equation. Otherwise, print "No" without quotes.
