# [Rhezo and Prime Problems][link]

Rhezo and his friend Vanya love problem solving. They have a problem set containing N problems, with points assigned to each. Rhezo wants to solve problems in such a way that he gets the maximum number of points. Rhezo has a weird habit of solving only prime number of consecutive problems, that is, if he solves X consecutive problems from the problem set, then X should be prime. Vanya has already solved all problems from the problem set and he wonders how much maximum points Rhezo can get. Vanya can answer this, but can you?

## Input format

- First line contains a single integer N, denoting the number of problems in the problem set.
- Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the points assigned to the problems.

## Output format

Print a single integer, the maximum points Rhezo can get.
