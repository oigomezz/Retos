# [Power of Twos][link]

Little Jhool is friend with the magical creature from Koi Mil Gaya as we all know, called Jaadu.

Now, Jhool is learning Mathematics from Jaadu; he wants to know about the Mathematics of the other planet, too.

In Jaadu's planet, the sequence of powers of two are called the: The JP. (Jaadu power!) That is, 2¹,2²,2³,...,2^(10000000). 10.000.000 being the limit known to the people on Jaadu's planet. Also, Jhool is smart so he notices that this particular sequence starts from index 1 and NOT 0. Now since Jhool thinks that he's understood the sequence well, already so he challenges Jaadu.

Jaadu gives him a number, denoted by N, and asks Jhool to find the number of pairs (i,j) such that (JP[i] - 1) divides (JP[j] - 1) and 1 <= i < j <= N. Jhool is stunned by this difficult question. And needs your help!

## Input format

- First line contains number of test cases T.
- Each test cases contains single integer N.

## Output format

For each test case print total numbers of pairs (i,j) such that 1 <= i < j <= N and (JP[i] - 1) is divisors of (JP[j] - 1).
