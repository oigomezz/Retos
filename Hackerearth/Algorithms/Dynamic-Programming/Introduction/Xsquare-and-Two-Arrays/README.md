# [Xsquare And Two Arrays][link]

Xsquare loves to play with arrays a lot. Today, he has two arrays named as A and B. Each array consists of N positive integers.

Xsquare has decided to fulfill following types of queries over his array A and array B.

- 1 L R : Print the value of AL + BL+1 + AL+2 + BL+3 + ... upto Rth term.
- 2 L R : Print the value of BL + AL+1 + BL+2 + AL+3 + ... upto Rth term.

## Input format

- First line of input contains two space separated integers N and Q denoting the size of arrays ( A , B ) and number of queries respectively.
- Next N lines of input contains N space separated integers denoting array A.
- Next line of input contains N space separated integers denoting array B.
- Next Q lines of input contains Q queries (one per line).
- Each query has one of the above mentioned types.

## Output format

Output consists of Q lines, each containing answer to the corresponding query.
