# [The maximum set][link]

You are given an array A of N integer elements. A pair of elements (i,j) is said to be an inversion if A[i] > A[j] and i < j for all 1 <= i,j <= N.

Using this array A, you create an undirected graph G of N vertices. For each inversion pair (i,j), there exists an edge between vertex i and j.

Find the maximum size of set S consisting of vertices from graph G such that there exists an edge between every pair of vertices present in S.

## Input format

- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains an integer N.
- The second line of each test case contains space-separated integers denoting array A.

## Output format

For each test case, print the maximum size of set S in a new line.
