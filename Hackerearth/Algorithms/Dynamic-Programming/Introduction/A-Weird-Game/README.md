# [A Weird Game][link]

Given two strings S and T where T is a subsequence of S, you need to find the number of pairs of indices (i,j), where i <= j, such that if we delete a non-empty substring S[i ... j] from string S and concatenate the remaining two parts, string T still remains a subsequence of string S. Note that we consider each pair (i,j) of indices independent of all other pairs.

## Input format

- The first line of the input consists of a single integer t, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case consists of string S.
- The second line of each test case consists of string T.

## Output format

For each test case, print the required answer in a separate line.
