# [Analytically Stable][link]

You are given with a number N. A 4 digit number is said to be "Analytically Stable", if the four digits of the number are of the form, {x,x,x+1,x+1}, where 0 <= x < 9.

Your task is to pick 4 digit subsequences of the given number N, such that the 4 digit number formed by them is Analytically Stable.

Output the number of such sub-sequences. As answer may be too large, output the answer mod 10⁹ + 7.

## Input format

- The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains a number N.

## Output format

For each test case output the number of Analytically Stable sub-sequences mod 10⁹ + 7.
