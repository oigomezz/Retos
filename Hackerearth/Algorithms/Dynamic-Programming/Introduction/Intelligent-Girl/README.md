Soumika has a string S and its starting index is 1. The string S consists of characters from 1-9. As she is very intelligent, she wants to test his brother Vinay Tendulkar. She asked her brother Vinay Tendulkar to count the number of even numbered characters ( i.e 2,4,6,8) for every index i (1 <= i <= |S|). For an index i, the result should be calculated from i to the end of the string. As Vinay doesn't know about programming, he wants you to help him find the solution.
