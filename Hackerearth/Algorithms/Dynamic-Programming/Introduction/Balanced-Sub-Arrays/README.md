# [Balanced Sub-Arrays][link]

An array B is called balanced if parity(sum(B)) = parity(lcm(B)). Given an array A of size N, find the count of balanced sub-arrays of A.

As of friendly reminder,

- parity(x) denotes the remainder of dividing x by 2.
- A sub-array is the sequence of consecutive elements of the array.

## Input format

- The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers ​A1,A2,...,AN.

## Output format

For each test case print a single integer — the answer to the problem.
