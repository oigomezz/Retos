# [Digit strings][link]

You are given a string S of length N. You are also given an integer K. The string consists of digits from 1 - 9 only. Determine the number of ways to partition the string S such that each segment value is less than K.

If there is no way to perform partition on the string, then print 0.

Since the answer could be a large, print the answer as 10‚Åπ + 7.

## Input format

- First line: of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - First line: Two space-separated integers N and K.
  - Second line: A string S of size N.

## Output format

Print the required answer.
