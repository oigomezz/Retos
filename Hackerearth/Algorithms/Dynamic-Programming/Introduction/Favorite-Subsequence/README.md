# [Favorite Subsequence][link]

You are given a String S of length N.

Now, a good subsequence is one that can be represented in the form a^(i)b^(j)c^(k), where i >= 1, j >= 1 and k >= 1. In short, a good subsequence is a subsequence that first consist of i a characters, followed by j b characters, followed by k c characters, where i >= 1, j >= 1 and k >= 1.

Now, you need to find the number of good subsequences of String S. As the number of such subsequences could be rather large, print the answer Modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.

**Note:** Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2 subsequences are different.

## Input format

- The first and only line of input contains the S.

## Output format

Print the required answer on a single line.
